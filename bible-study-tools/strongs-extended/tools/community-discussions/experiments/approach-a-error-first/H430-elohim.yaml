      why_tempting: |
        Trinity is central Christian doctrine - want OT support.
        Plural form seems like obvious evidence.
        Genesis 1 is foundational text - finding Trinity there powerful.
        Simple argument, easy to teach and remember.
        Counters unitarian objections with "linguistic proof."
        Feels like objective evidence rather than interpretation.

    # === SCHOLARLY REFUTATION ===
    scholarly_refutation:
      correction: |
        Elohim's plural form does NOT prove the Trinity. It's a standard Hebrew grammatical
        feature called "plural of majesty" or "plural of intensity" - emphasizing
        greatness, not numerical plurality. Trinity is biblically defensible, but not
        from this grammatical form alone. Lexical meaning ≠ theological doctrine.

      evidence:
        - type: "grammatical"
          fact: "Elohim (plural noun) consistently takes SINGULAR verbs when referring to YHWH"
          source: "{bdb} {biblical-hebrew-grammar}"
          authority: "HIGH"
          note: "Singular verb shows singular subject, not plural persons"

        - type: "grammatical"
          fact: "Hebrew has 'plural of majesty' or 'plural of intensity' - grammatical intensification"
          source: "{niv-study-bible} {hebrew-grammar}"
          authority: "HIGH"
          note: "Standard feature - plural form for singular majestic entity"

        - type: "lexical"
          fact: "BDB defines Elohim: '(1) rulers, judges (2) divine ones (3) angels (4) gods (5) God (singular usage)'"
          source: "{bdb}"
          authority: "HIGH"
          note: "Lexicon recognizes singular reference despite plural form"

        - type: "usage"
          fact: "Elohim used for false gods (definitely plural beings) - not unique to YHWH"
          source: "{bdb} {biblical-usage}"
          authority: "HIGH"
          example: "Exodus 12:12 'gods of Egypt' (plural beings) uses same word"

        - type: "translation"
          fact: "LXX (Greek OT) translates Elohim with SINGULAR θεός (theos), not plural θεοί"

      correct_understanding:
        grammatical_feature: |
          Plural of majesty/intensity: Hebrew uses plural forms to express greatness,
          majesty, or fullness - NOT numerical plurality {hebrew-grammar}
          Evidence: Singular verbs with Elohim prove singular subject {bdb}

        lexical_range: |
          Elohim can mean:
          1. God (YHWH) - singular despite plural form {bdb}
          2. gods (false deities) - actual plural {bdb}
          3. angels, divine beings - plural {bdb}
          4. judges, rulers (as God's representatives) - plural {bdb}
          Context and verb number determine which sense applies.

        theological_note: |
          Trinity IS defensible biblically (Matthew 28:19, John 1:1, etc.).
          BUT: Elohim plural form alone doesn't prove it {biblical-scholarship}

          Better Trinity arguments:
          - NT explicit trinitarian formulas {matthew-28-19}
          - Divine persons identified (Father, Son, Spirit) {nt-theology}
          - Early church creeds {nicene-creed}

          Don't rely on Hebrew grammar for core doctrine {llm-cs45}

      secondary_types:

        - "anachronism"  # Imposes later theological category onto earlier text

      contributing_factors:
        - "Central Christian doctrine needs OT support"
        - "Plural form seems like obvious evidence"
        - "Genesis 1 is foundational - powerful to find Trinity there"

    # === PEDAGOGICAL GUIDANCE ===
    helpful_guidance:
      what_to_avoid: |
        Do NOT claim Elohim plural form "proves" Trinity.
        Do NOT use Hebrew grammar as primary Trinity defense.
        Do NOT ignore singular verb usage.
        Do NOT overlook that Elohim also means "gods" (plural beings).
        Avoid: "The Hebrew word for God is plural, proving Trinity" (oversimplification).

      alternative_framing: |
        **Accurate teaching:**

        "Elohim is a Hebrew plural form used with SINGULAR verbs when referring to the
        one true God. This 'plural of majesty' emphasizes God's greatness and fullness,
        not numerical plurality {hebrew-grammar}."

        "The Trinity is clearly taught in the NEW Testament (Matthew 28:19, 2 Cor 13:14)
        and implicit in the OT through multiple appearances of YHWH, the Angel of the LORD,
        and God's Spirit. Hebrew grammar alone doesn't prove doctrine."

        "Trinitarian doctrine comes from CUMULATIVE biblical revelation, not single
        grammatical features {systematic-theology}."

      memory_aid: |
        Think: Elohim + singular verb = singular God (grammar shows meaning)
        Not: Elohim plural form = plural persons (grammar ≠ doctrine)

        Valid: Trinity taught in Scripture (NT explicit + OT implicit)
        Invalid: Elohim grammar proves Trinity (grammatical feature ≠ theological proof)

      tone_note: |
        **Be EXTRA gracious** - Trinity is core doctrine, believers sincere.

        "While the Trinity is absolutely true and central to Christian faith, the
        plural form of Elohim isn't the best argument for it. Hebrew grammar has
        'plural of majesty' - singular verbs prove singular meaning. Let's use
        clearer NT evidence (Matthew 28:19, John 1:1) rather than Hebrew grammar."

# === COMMON QUESTIONS ===

common_questions:
  - id: 1
    question: "If Elohim doesn't prove the Trinity, why is it plural?"

    source:
      platform: "theological_question"
      context: "Common follow-up when corrected"

    expert_answer:
      answer: |
        Hebrew has "plural of majesty" or "plural of intensity" - grammatical feature
        using plural forms for singular majestic entities {hebrew-grammar}

        **Evidence for SINGULAR meaning:**
        1. **Singular verbs:** "Elohim created" (בָּרָא bara - singular verb) not plural {genesis-1-1}
        2. **Singular pronouns:** When Elohim speaks, uses singular "I," not "we" usually {biblical-usage}
        3. **Translation:** LXX uses SINGULAR θεός (theos) consistently {lxx}
        4. **Usage:** Emphatic word for singular God's greatness {bdb}

        **Analogy:** English "Your Majesty" (singular king) or "royal we" (one person speaking)

        **Theological note:** This DOESN'T undermine Trinity - just means grammar isn't the proof {llm-cs45}

    question: "What about Genesis 1:26 'Let US make man' - doesn't that prove plural?"

    source:
      platform: "related_apologetics_claim"
      context: "Often paired with Elohim plural argument"

    expert_answer:
      answer: |
        Genesis 1:26 "Let US make man in OUR image" is debated, with multiple interpretations:

        **Option 1: Divine Council** (God + angels)
        - "Us" = God addressing heavenly court {psalm-82} {job-38-7}
        - Common in ANE literature {ancient-near-east-parallels}
        - Explanation: God announces plan to divine council

        **Option 2: Plural of Deliberation**
        - Hebrew idiom for self-deliberation
        - Like English "Let's see..." (one person thinking)

        **Option 3: Trinitarian Foreshadowing**
        - Compatible with Trinity, not proof of it
        - Requires NT revelation to recognize {nt-theology}
        - Christians can see Trinity here, but grammar doesn't demand it

        **Key Point:** Multiple interpretations exist. Don't claim grammar "proves" doctrine.
        Trinity stands on FULL biblical revelation, not single verses {systematic-theology}
