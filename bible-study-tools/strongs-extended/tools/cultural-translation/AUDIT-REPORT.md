# Cultural Translation Tool - STAGES.md v2.0 Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-11-15
**Auditor:** Research Agent
**Tool Status:** Planning complete, ready for implementation
**STAGES.md Version:** v2.0 (Redesigned with Experimentation Patterns)

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Compliance:** 🔴 **Stage 1 Only** (Planning/Design)

The Cultural Translation tool has completed comprehensive planning and methodology design, including 3 pilot sample entries (G26 agape, H7950 snow, G721 lamb). However, **no actual experimentation against STAGES.md v2.0 has been conducted**. The tool is currently at Stage 1 (planning) with methodological design complete but awaiting pilot execution.

**Critical Gap:** Tool marked as "Planning complete, ready for implementation" in TOOLS.md, but has not progressed through the 8-stage experimentation workflow required by STAGES.md v2.0.

---

## Detailed Stage-by-Stage Audit

### ✅ STAGE 1: Tool Selection & Test Set Development (COMPLETE)

#### 1.1 Tool Selected ✅
- **Tool:** Cultural Translation
- **Purpose:** Document proven solutions for translating culturally non-existent concepts
- **Commitment:** 4 months timeline documented
- **Status:** Tool selected, schema understood

#### 1.2 Word Classification Strategy ✅
**Classification completed:**
- **Category 1:** Non-existent physical concepts (snow, lamb, camel)
- **Category 2:** Untranslatable abstracts (agape, grace, righteousness)
- **Category 3:** Cultural sensitivities (taboo numbers, offensive animals)
- **Category 4:** Semantic gaps (missing/extra distinctions)

**Extraction Strategy:** Corpus-based pattern extraction from 900+ translations
- **Note:** Classification is by challenge type, not word frequency (theological/grammatical/nominal)
- **Alignment with STAGES.md:** Partial - word type classification exists but organized differently

#### 1.3 Test Set Development 🔴 **MISSING**
**CRITICAL GAP:** No authoritative test set developed

**Current status:**
- 3 pilot samples documented (G26, H7950, G721)
- These are examples in planning docs, NOT a proper test set
- No stratification by frequency (rare/medium/high)
- No stratification by word type (theological/grammatical/nominal)
- No stratification by lexicon coverage
- No adversarial cases (30% requirement)
- No blind selection protocol

**Required by STAGES.md:**
- 30-50 words total
- Stratified by frequency, word type, lexicon coverage
- 30% adversarial cases
- Blind selection (subagent selects, main agent doesn't see criteria)

**Recommendation:** Create proper test set before experimentation begins

#### 1.4 Design 3 Fundamentally Different Approaches 🔴 **MISSING**

**CRITICAL GAP:** Only ONE approach documented (corpus-based pattern extraction)

**Current approach:**
- Extract cultural adaptations from 900+ translation corpus
- Document solutions by challenge category
- Classify strategy (substitute, describe, loan, metaphor)
- Provide theological validation

**Missing:**
- Approach B (alternative methodology)
- Approach C (third alternative)
- Hypothesis statements for each approach
- Source priority differences
- Structure/organization differences

**Examples of what alternative approaches could test:**
- **Approach A (Current):** Corpus-based pattern extraction
  - Hypothesis: "900+ translations provide empirical solutions"
  - Sources: TBTA corpus primary
  - Structure: Challenge category → solutions documented

- **Approach B (SIL/Wycliffe Case Studies):**
  - Hypothesis: "Deep case study analysis reveals principles"
  - Sources: SIL/Wycliffe documented challenges, Peace Child methodology
  - Structure: Redemptive analogy → cultural bridge → solution

- **Approach C (Anthropological Framework):**
  - Hypothesis: "Cultural anthropology predicts translation patterns"
  - Sources: Scholarly research on receptor languages, missiological journals
  - Structure: Cultural analysis → semantic mapping → adaptation strategy

**Recommendation:** Design 2 additional approaches before Round 1 experiments

### Evaluation

**✅ Proper Structure:** experiments/ subdirectory exists in /plan
**⚠️ Content Type:** pilot-samples.md contains planning examples, not actual experiment runs
**🔴 No Pilot Runs:** No experiments have been executed against test sets

### Reorganization Needed

**Current Status:**
- experiments/pilot-samples.md = Planning examples, not experimental runs
- Should be renamed to: experiments/planning-examples.md

**When actual experiments begin:**
```
experiments/
├── planning-examples.md (3 design samples)
├── round-1/
│   ├── approach-a/ (corpus-based)
│   ├── approach-b/ (case-study)
│   └── approach-c/ (anthropological)
├── round-2/ (refinement runs)
├── ... (rounds 3-9)
└── results-summary.md
```

**Recommendation:** Rename pilot-samples.md to clarify it's planning, not experimentation

---

## Action Plan for Pilot Experiments

### Phase 1: Complete Stage 1 (2-3 hours)

**Step 1.3: Develop Authoritative Test Set**
1. **Spawn subagent** to select 30-50 words with blind protocol
2. **Stratification requirements:**
   - Frequency: 10-15 rare, 15-20 medium, 5-10 high
   - Word type: 40% theological, 30% grammatical, 30% nominal
   - Coverage: 40% rich, 40% moderate, 20% sparse
   - 30% adversarial (controversial etymology, lexicon divergence, cultural sensitivity)

3. **Document test set** at: `/bible-study-tools/strongs-extended/tools/cultural-translation/TEST-SET.md`

**Step 1.4: Design 3 Approaches**
1. **Document Approach A (Corpus-Based):**
   - Hypothesis: "900+ translations provide empirical solutions"
   - Primary sources: TBTA corpus, statistical pattern extraction
   - Structure: Challenge category → documented solutions

2. **Design Approach B (Case Study Depth):**
   - Hypothesis: "Deep case studies reveal transferable principles"
   - Primary sources: SIL/Wycliffe case studies, Peace Child methodology
   - Structure: Redemptive analogy → cultural bridge → solution principles

3. **Design Approach C (Anthropological Framework):**
   - Hypothesis: "Cultural analysis predicts effective adaptations"
   - Primary sources: Missiological journals, cultural anthropology research
   - Structure: Cultural worldview → semantic mapping → adaptation strategy

4. **Document all 3 approaches** at: `/bible-study-tools/strongs-extended/tools/cultural-translation/APPROACHES.md`

### Phase 2: Execute Round 1 (6-10 hours)

**Step 2.1: Run All 3 Approaches**
1. Select 3-5 test words from stratified test set
2. Run Approach A on each word (corpus extraction)
3. Run Approach B on each word (case study analysis)
4. Run Approach C on each word (anthropological framework)
5. Save outputs: `{word}.strongs-cultural-approach{A|B|C}.yaml`

**Step 2.2: Source Access Optimization**
1. Document access methods for each approach:
   - WebFetch templatable URLs (BEST)
   - WebFetch query params (GOOD)
   - WebSearch (ACCEPTABLE)
   - Manual navigation (POOR)
2. Create comparison table with scalability assessment

**Step 2.3: Broad Review Committee**
1. Spawn 8-10 specialized reviewers:
   - Cultural Sensitivity Reviewer
   - Theological Accuracy Reviewer
   - Corpus Validation Reviewer
   - Translation Usefulness Reviewer
   - Source Reliability Reviewer
   - Biblical Context Reviewer
   - Cross-Cultural Patterns Reviewer
   - Redemptive Analogy Validator
   - Fair Use Compliance Reviewer
   - Data Completeness Reviewer

2. Each reviewer asks 5-8 targeted questions
3. Track which reviewers find which issues

**Step 2.4: Apply 3-Level Validation**
1. Level 1 (100%): No fabrication, inline citations, sources verified
2. Level 2 (track improvement): Multiple solutions, strategy classification
3. Level 3 (track improvement): Evaluation criteria, translator guidance
4. Document baseline pass rates for all 3 approaches

**Step 2.5: Cross-Approach Evaluation**
1. Create comparison table across quality, time, scalability
2. Decision point: Clear winner? Complementary? All insufficient?

### Phase 3: Document and Iterate (2-3 hours)

1. **Create Round 1 summary** at: `/bible-study-tools/strongs-extended/tools/cultural-translation/experiments/round-1/RESULTS.md`
2. **Update METRICS.md** with actual data (replace aspirational with empirical)
3. **Document winner** or blend approach
4. **Plan Round 2** refinement strategy

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Any Pilot Work)

1. **✅ Create TEST-SET.md**
   - Use blind subagent selection protocol
   - 30-50 words, stratified by frequency/type/coverage
   - 30% adversarial cases
   - Document in `/bible-study-tools/strongs-extended/tools/cultural-translation/TEST-SET.md`

2. **✅ Document 3 Approaches in APPROACHES.md**
   - Approach A: Corpus-based (current plan)
   - Approach B: Case study depth (SIL/Wycliffe, Peace Child)
   - Approach C: Anthropological framework (cultural analysis)
   - Include hypothesis, sources, structure for each
   - Document in `/bible-study-tools/strongs-extended/tools/cultural-translation/APPROACHES.md`

3. **✅ Define Review Committee**
   - 8-10 specialized reviewers with question frameworks
   - Document in methodology or create REVIEW-COMMITTEE.md

4. **✅ Rename pilot-samples.md**
   - Current: `experiments/pilot-samples.md` (misleading)
   - Better: `experiments/planning-examples.md` (accurate)
   - Location: Keep in `/plan/strongs-cultural-translation/experiments/`

### Pilot Execution Sequence

1. **Week 1:** Complete Stage 1 (test set + 3 approaches)
2. **Week 2:** Execute Round 1 (9-15 runs across 3 approaches)
3. **Week 3:** Review committee evaluation, cross-approach comparison
4. **Week 4:** Select winner, plan Rounds 2-5 refinement

### Long-Term Integration

1. **Migrate to STAGES.md v2.0 workflow** completely
2. **Track improvement metrics** at each round (not just aspirational targets)
3. **Apply stopping criteria** (<5% improvement = diminishing returns)
4. **Level 4 validation** with real practitioners (translators, pastors, students)

## Current Tool Status vs TOOLS.md Claim

**TOOLS.md says:** "📋 Planning complete, ready for implementation"

**Reality:** Planning IS complete, but **not ready for implementation** until:
1. ✅ Test set developed (Stage 1.3)
2. ✅ 3 approaches documented (Stage 1.4)
3. ✅ Review committee defined (Stage 2.3)
4. ✅ Source access optimization planned (Stage 2.2)

**Recommended TOOLS.md update:**
```markdown
### 📋 Cultural Translation
**Status:** 🔄 Stage 1 (Test Set Development) | **Timeline:** 4 months | **See:** `./cultural-translation/docs/`
```

---

## Conclusion

The Cultural Translation tool has **excellent planning documentation** but has not yet entered the STAGES.md v2.0 experimentation workflow. The tool is at **Stage 1 (partial)** - tool selected and methodology designed, but missing test set and multiple approaches required to begin Round 1 experiments.

**Critical Path to Production:**
1. Complete Stage 1.3-1.4 (test set + 3 approaches) ← **BLOCKING**
2. Execute Rounds 1-9 (60-103 runs expected)
3. Level 4 usefulness validation (practitioner testing)
4. Production deployment with stopping criteria

**Estimated Timeline:**
- Stage 1 completion: 2-3 hours
- Round 1 experiments: 6-10 hours
- Rounds 2-9: 30-50 hours (depends on word complexity)
- Total: ~40-65 hours (4-8 weeks at part-time pace)

**Next Step:** Create TEST-SET.md and APPROACHES.md before any experimentation begins.
