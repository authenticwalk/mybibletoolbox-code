# Cultural Translation Tool - Summary

**Date:** 2025-11-15
**Status:** Stage 1 (Partial) - Planning Complete, Experimentation Pending
**STAGES.md v2.0 Compliance:** 12.5% (1 of 8 stages)

---

## Quick Overview

**What This Tool Does:**
Documents proven solutions for translating culturally non-existent concepts (snow in tropics, lamb in Arctic, agape love in merit-based cultures) using 900+ Bible translations as empirical evidence.

**Current State:**
- ✅ Comprehensive planning (834-line methodology, 1011-line pilot samples)
- ✅ Output schema defined
- ✅ Data sources identified
- 🔴 **MISSING:** Test set (30-50 words), 3 approaches, actual experimentation

**Why Incomplete:**
Tool planned BEFORE STAGES.md v2.0 methodology existed. Planning is excellent, but has not entered the 8-stage experimentation workflow required for production readiness.

---

## Critical Gaps (Blocking Experimentation)

### 1. No Test Set (STAGES 1.3)
**Required:** 30-50 words, stratified by:
- Frequency: rare/medium/high
- Word type: theological/grammatical/nominal
- Challenge type: non-existent/untranslatable/sensitive/semantic
- 30% adversarial cases

**Current:** Only 3 planning examples exist

### 2. Only 1 Approach (STAGES 1.4)
**Required:** 3 fundamentally different approaches to test strategic directions

**Current Approach:**
- Corpus-based pattern extraction from 900+ translations

**Missing Approaches:**
- Approach B: Case study depth (SIL/Wycliffe, Peace Child)
- Approach C: Anthropological framework (cultural worldview mapping)

### 3. No Review Committee Defined (STAGES 2.3)
**Required:** 8-10 specialized reviewers with question frameworks

**Current:** Not defined

### 4. Zero Experiment Runs (STAGES 2-8)
**Expected:** 60-103 runs (30-50 words × 2-3 revisions)

**Current:** 0 runs completed

## Immediate Next Steps

**PRIORITY 1 (BLOCKING):**
1. ✅ Create TEST-SET.md (use blind subagent selection)
2. ✅ Create APPROACHES.md (document 3 approaches with hypotheses)
3. ✅ Define review committee (10 reviewers, question frameworks)

**PRIORITY 2 (After P1):**
4. Execute Round 1 (9-15 runs across 3 approaches)
5. Source access optimization analysis
6. Cross-approach evaluation
7. Select winner or blend approaches

**See ACTION-PLAN.md for full execution roadmap**

## Timeline Estimate

| Phase | Work | Hours |
|-------|------|-------|
| Phase 1 | Complete Stage 1 (test set + approaches) | 2-3h |
| Phase 2 | Round 1 experiments | 6-10h |
| Phase 3 | Rounds 2-5 refinement | 12-20h |
| Phase 4 | Round 6 winner selection | 4-6h |
| Phase 5 | Rounds 7-8 deep refinement | 8-12h |
| Phase 6 | Round 9 optimization | 4-6h |
| Phase 7 | Level 4 usefulness validation | 6-8h |
| Phase 8 | Production validation | 4-6h |
| **TOTAL** | | **40-65 hours (4-8 weeks)** |

## Strengths of Existing Planning

1. **✅ Excellent Methodology Design**
   - 4-step process (core meaning → cultural gap → research solutions → translator guidance)
   - Clear challenge categories
   - Theological awareness
   - Multi-perspective validation

2. **✅ Strategic Data Source Identification**
   - 900+ Bible translations (TBTA corpus)
   - SIL/Wycliffe case studies
   - Peace Child methodology
   - Scholarly research

3. **✅ Well-Defined Schema**
   - Core meaning to preserve
   - Translation challenges documented
   - Solutions with evaluation
   - Translator guidance

4. **✅ Quality Standards Documented**
   - Level 1: 100% corpus-based
   - Level 2: Multiple solutions, strategy classification
   - Level 3: Evaluation criteria, translator guidance
   - Level 4: Practitioner usefulness (mentioned)

## Why This Matters

**Translation Impact:**
Prevents literal translations that fail to communicate meaning:
- "Snow" → Hawaiian "hau" (ice/frost metaphor) preserves purity imagery
- "Lamb" → Inuktitut "nattiq" (seal pup) preserves sacrifice while culturally meaningful
- "Agape" → Swahili "upendo" with teaching emphasis on volitional choice

**AI Grounding:**
Provides context for culturally-sensitive translation choices, helping AI systems recommend appropriate adaptations rather than literal failures.

## Relationship to Other Strong's Tools

**Lexical Research (Tools 1-4):**
- Answers: "What does this word mean?" (etymology, semantics, usage)

**TBTA Hints (Grammatical):**
- Answers: "How do languages grammatically express this?" (number, person, proximity)

**Cultural Translation (This Tool):**
- Answers: "What word/concept when original doesn't exist?" (cultural adaptation)

**Together:** Complete translation guidance (meaning + grammar + cultural context)

## Production Readiness Checklist

**Stage 1:**
- [x] Tool selected
- [ ] Test set (30-50 words, stratified)
- [ ] 3 approaches documented

**Stage 2:**
- [ ] Round 1 experiments (9-15 runs)
- [ ] Source access optimization
- [ ] Review committee evaluation
- [ ] Cross-approach comparison

**Stages 3-8:**
- [ ] Refinement rounds (until <5% improvement)
- [ ] Review committee optimization
- [ ] Level 4 usefulness validation (70%+)
- [ ] Production methodology documented

---

## Conclusion

The Cultural Translation tool has **excellent planning** but needs to complete Stage 1 and execute the full STAGES.md v2.0 experimentation workflow before production deployment.

**Current Status:** Ready to begin experimentation after test set and approach design
**Estimated Timeline:** 4-8 weeks to production
**Blocking Issues:** TEST-SET.md + APPROACHES.md + Review committee definition

**Next Action:** Create TEST-SET.md using blind subagent selection protocol
