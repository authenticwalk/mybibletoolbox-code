# Round 1 Word Selection - Strategic Testing

**Date:** 2025-11-15
**Selection Strategy:** Option 2 (Strategic Test)
**Total Words:** 5 (will test all 3 approaches on each = 15 experiments)

---

## Strategic Selection Rationale

Each word selected to test a specific approach's claimed strength:

### Word 1: G1967 εἰπιούσιος (epiousios) - **Tests Approach C Strength**
**Strong's:** G1967
**Translation:** "daily" (Lord's Prayer - Matthew 6:11, Luke 11:3)
**Frequency:** Hapax legomenon (2 occurrences, same phrase)
**Type:** Rare nominal

**Why Selected:**
- **CRITICAL TEST for Approach C (Primary-Source-Diachronic)**
- Hapax with **NO modern journal articles** (Approach A weakness confirmed)
- Disputed etymology: *epi + ousia* ("supersubstantial") vs *epi + ienai* ("for tomorrow")
- **No classical Greek parallels** - requires primary source investigation
- Patristic interpretations diverge significantly (Origen vs Jerome)

**Expected Results:**
- Approach A (Journal): Will struggle (0 peer-reviewed articles)
- Approach B (Commentary): Will provide translation options but limited depth
- **Approach C (Primary-Source): Should excel** - patristic sources, etymology analysis

**Strategic Value:** Tests if Primary-Source approach delivers on rare word claim

---

### Word 2: G4151 πνεῦμα (pneuma) - **Tests Approach A Strength**
**Strong's:** G4151
**Translation:** "spirit, wind, breath"
**Frequency:** High (379 occurrences)
**Type:** Theological (multivalent)

**Why Selected:**
- **Tests Approach A (Journal-Emphasis) claimed strength**
- **Extensive scholarly debate:** Spirit vs spirit vs wind vs breath
- Capitalization debates (Holy Spirit vs human spirit)
- Trinitarian theological implications
- Multiple peer-reviewed journal articles available (JBL, CBQ on pneumatology)

**Expected Results:**
- **Approach A (Journal): Should excel** - multiple scholarly perspectives documented
- Approach B (Commentary): Will synthesize debates efficiently
- Approach C (Primary-Source): Will provide diachronic development (Hebrew *ruach* → Greek *pneuma*)

**Strategic Value:** Tests if Journal-Emphasis delivers superior scholarly debate coverage

---

### Word 3: G0026 ἀγάπη (agapē) - **Tests Approach B Efficiency**
**Strong's:** G0026
**Translation:** "love" (divine/sacrificial)
**Frequency:** Medium (116 occurrences)
**Type:** Theological central

**Why Selected:**
- **Tests Approach B (Commentary-Synthesis) efficiency claim**
- Well-documented in major commentaries (Brown, Keener, Fee on 1 Cor 13, 1 John)
- **Rich commentary coverage** should enable fast synthesis
- Already tested in Approach A (G26 was tested) - allows direct time comparison
- Not rare (eliminates Primary-Source advantage)
- Not heavily debated (eliminates Journal-Emphasis advantage)

**Expected Results:**
- Approach A (Journal): 180 min (baseline from existing experiment)
- **Approach B (Commentary): Should be significantly faster (90-120 min)** - efficiency test
- Approach C (Primary-Source): 100-120 min (diachronic depth but not rare word advantage)

**Strategic Value:** Tests if Commentary-Synthesis delivers 25%+ time savings claim

---

### Word 4: G0725 ἁρπαγμός (harpagmos) - **Adversarial/Theological Debate**
**Strong's:** G0725
**Translation:** "robbery, something to grasp" (Philippians 2:6)
**Frequency:** Hapax legomenon (1 occurrence)
**Type:** Rare theological (Christological)

**Why Selected:**
- **ADVERSARIAL CASE:** Active vs passive sense debate (*res rapienda* vs *res rapta*)
- Major Christological implications (Christ's pre-existence, equality with God)
- Rare morphological form (verbal noun)
- Tests all 3 approaches on theologically loaded rare word

**Expected Results:**
- Approach A (Journal): Some journal coverage (Christology articles)
- Approach B (Commentary): Extensive exegetical discussion (Philippians commentaries)
- Approach C (Primary-Source): Classical background + patristic Christology

**Strategic Value:** Tests how all approaches handle rare + theologically controversial words

---

### Word 5: G2962 κύριος (kurios) - **Baseline High-Frequency Theological**
**Strong's:** G2962
**Translation:** "lord, master, owner, Lord (divine title)"
**Frequency:** Very high (717 occurrences)
**Type:** Theological (title/designation)

**Why Selected:**
- **BASELINE COMPARISON:** High-frequency theological word
- Tests all approaches on common theological term
- Multiple contexts: secular (master), religious (Lord), christological (Lord Jesus)
- LXX background (translates YHWH)
- Should be well-covered by all approaches

**Expected Results:**
- Approach A (Journal): Abundant sources, but time-intensive
- Approach B (Commentary): Efficient synthesis, comprehensive coverage
- Approach C (Primary-Source): Strong LXX → NT development, patristic usage

**Strategic Value:** Establishes baseline performance across all 3 approaches

## Summary Matrix

| Word | Strong's | Frequency | Tests Approach | Expected Winner | Strategic Purpose |
|------|----------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| εἰπιούσιος | G1967 | Rare (2) | **C advantage** | Approach C | Tests rare word claim |
| πνεῦμα | G4151 | High (379) | **A advantage** | Approach A | Tests debate coverage |
| ἀγάπη | G0026 | Medium (116) | **B efficiency** | Approach B | Tests speed claim |
| ἁρπαγμός | G0725 | Rare (1) | Adversarial | Mixed | Tests controversy handling |
| κύριος | G2962 | Very High (717) | Baseline | Mixed | Baseline comparison |

## Stratification Verification

**Frequency Distribution:**
- Rare (<10): 2 words (G1967, G0725) = 40%
- Medium (50-500): 1 word (G0026) = 20%
- High (1000+): 2 words (G4151, G2962) = 40%

**Word Type:**
- Theological: 4 words (G4151, G0026, G0725, G2962) = 80%
- Nominal: 1 word (G1967) = 20%

**Adversarial:**
- 2 adversarial cases (G1967, G0725) = 40%
- 3 standard cases (G4151, G0026, G2962) = 60%

**Lexicon Coverage:**
- Rich (TDNT, LSJ, Trench): 4 words (G4151, G0026, G2962, G0725) = 80%
- Sparse (limited sources): 1 word (G1967) = 20%

## Expected Outcomes

### If Each Approach Wins Its Test:
- **G1967 (epiousios):** Approach C wins (primary sources)
- **G4151 (pneuma):** Approach A wins (journal debates)
- **G0026 (agapē):** Approach B wins (commentary efficiency)
- **G0725 (harpagmos):** Mixed (depends on which strength matters more)
- **G2962 (kurios):** Baseline (all perform similarly)

**Result:** Need blend (different approaches for different word types)

### If One Approach Dominates All:
- **Approach A wins all:** Journal-Emphasis is superior
- **Approach B wins all:** Commentary-Synthesis is optimal
- **Approach C wins all:** Primary-Source-Diachronic is best

**Result:** Single winner, proceed to refinement
