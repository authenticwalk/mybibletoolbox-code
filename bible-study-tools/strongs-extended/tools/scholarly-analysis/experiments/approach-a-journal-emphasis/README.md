# Approach A: Journal-Emphasis

**Status:** Rounds 2-5 refinement complete (5 words tested)
**Hypothesis:** "Peer-reviewed journals = highest authority for scholarly analysis"
**Date Range:** 2025-11-11 to 2025-11-14

---

## Approach Philosophy

**Core Thesis:**
Peer-reviewed journal articles represent the highest standard of academic scholarship. By prioritizing JBL, CBQ, NTS, and other premier journals, we ensure:
- Rigorous peer-review validation
- Current scholarly consensus
- Multiple scholarly perspectives
- Highest academic authority

**Source Hierarchy:**
1. **Tier 1A:** Peer-reviewed journal articles (JBL, CBQ, NTS, Novum Testamentum)
2. **Tier 1B:** Standard lexicons (BDAG, TDNT, LSJ, Louw-Nida)
3. **Tier 1C:** Major scholarly commentaries (Brown, Keener, Fee, Lincoln)
4. **Tier 2:** PhD dissertations, seminary monographs, systematic theologies

**Structure:**
```yaml
theological_significance:  # From journal articles first
scholarly_debates:         # Multiple journal perspectives
cultural_context:          # Archaeological journals, historical studies
diachronic_development:   # Classical sources + patristic studies
intertextual_connections:  # OT/LXX from journal articles
```

## Approach Strengths

**1. High Academic Authority** ✅
- All sources Tier 1-2 (zero Tier 3+ sources used)
- Peer-reviewed validation ensures scholarly consensus
- Journal articles provide multiple perspectives

**2. Works Excellently for Theological Central Terms** ✅
- G26 (agapē): 17 sources, 1 JBL article, abundant literature
- G3056 (logos): 12 sources, 5 journal articles, Johannine studies rich
- Fair representation verified (G907: 3 positions documented)

**3. Textual Criticism Capability** ✅
- G2316 (theos variant): Successfully handled complex manuscript evidence
- Demonstrated ability to document scholarly consensus vs. minority views
- Integrated paleographic, patristic, and theological dimensions

**4. Maintains Quality Standards** ✅
- L1 (critical) validation: 93-100% across all words
- L2 (high priority) validation: 85-100% across all words
- L3 (medium priority) validation: 89-100% across all words

---

## Approach Weaknesses

**CRITICAL: Struggles with Rare Words** ❌

**Evidence from Experiment 3 (G2160 eutrapelia):**
- **Journal articles found:** 0 (zero)
- **Peer-reviewed biblical studies articles:** NONE EXIST for hapax legomena
- **Most valuable sources:** Classical texts (Aristotle), not modern journals
- **Time investment:** 120 min for single-occurrence word with limited sources

**Insight:** Journal-emphasis approach is **source-scarce for rare words**. Alternative approaches prioritizing classical sources or diachronic analysis might perform better.

**Other Weaknesses:**

**1. Paywall Barriers** ⚠️
- Most journal articles behind JSTOR, Cambridge Core, Brill paywalls
- Limits full-text verification (Exp 2: 93% L1 due to access limits)
- Requires institutional library access for scalability

**2. Time-Intensive** ⚠️
- 180 minutes for theological central terms (agapē, logos)
- 120 minutes for rare words despite limited sources
- Would be impractical at scale without better access

**3. Limited Contemporary Scholarship for Rare Words** ⚠️
- Hapax legomena don't generate dedicated journal articles
- Must rely on lexicons and classical sources
- Questions whether journal-emphasis adds value for rare words

---

## Suitability Analysis

### Best For:
- ✅ **Theological central terms** (top 100-200 words) - abundant journal literature
- ✅ **Controversial terms** (denominational debates) - multiple scholarly perspectives
- ✅ **Textual variants** - established text-critical literature
- ✅ **NT study focus** - where peer-reviewed biblical studies articles exist

### Not Ideal For:
- ❌ **Rare hapax legomena** - no dedicated journal articles
- ❌ **Grammatical function words** - limited theological discussion
- ❌ **Words requiring primarily classical/diachronic analysis** - modern journals less valuable
- ❌ **Scalability without library access** - paywall barriers significant

## Comparison Needed

**STAGES.md v2.0 requires comparison with 2 alternative approaches:**

### Approach B: Commentary-Synthesis (NOT YET TESTED)
**Hypothesis:** "Major commentaries aggregate scholarship efficiently"
**Expected strength:** Faster research, better accessibility, comprehensive coverage
**Expected weakness:** Less current than journals, fewer multiple perspectives
**Test on:** Same 3-5 words for direct comparison

### Approach C: Primary-Source-Diachronic (NOT YET TESTED)
**Hypothesis:** "Classical sources + patristics show semantic development best"
**Expected strength:** Excellent for rare words, classical background, diachronic analysis
**Expected weakness:** Less engagement with contemporary scholarly debates
**Test on:** Same 3-5 words for direct comparison

## Key Learnings

### Learning 1: Source Access is CRITICAL Bottleneck
- Journal articles behind paywalls limit verification
- Institutional library access essential for scalability
- Without library access, journal-emphasis approach impractical

### Learning 2: Rare Words Need Different Approach
- Zero journal articles for eutrapelia (hapax legomenon)
- Classical sources (Aristotle, Philo, Josephus) more valuable
- Suggests Approach C (primary-source-diachronic) might excel for rare words

### Learning 3: Fair Representation is Achievable
- G907 (baptizō): 3 scholarly camps represented fairly
- Systematic theologies valid sources for denominational debates
- Neutral language and evidence-presentation avoids bias

### Learning 4: Time Estimates Vary by Word Type
- Theological central: 180 min (abundant sources)
- Rare hapax: 120 min (limited sources, not less work)
- Debated terms: ~150 min (multiple positions to research)
- Textual variants: ~120 min (focused text-critical analysis)

### Learning 5: Quality Maintainable Despite Access Limitations
- L1-L3 validation consistently high (85-100%)
- Zero Tier 3+ sources used (maintained authority)
- Conservative approach works when full-text unavailable

## Round 1 Comparison Criteria

When comparing Approach A vs B vs C (per STAGES.md v2.0 Stage 2.5):

| Criterion | Approach A Status |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Quality Score (avg)** | 8.5-9.0/10 (estimated from validation) |
| **L2 Pass Rate** | 85-100% (varies by word type) |
| **Time per word** | 120-180 min (varies by word type) |
| **Source Accessibility** | POOR (paywall barriers) |
| **Scalability** | LOW (requires library access) |
| **Review Issues Found** | Not tracked (no review committee used) |

**Expected Winner Scenarios:**

**If Approach A wins:** Proceed to Rounds 7-8 optimization
**If Approach B wins:** Commentary-synthesis faster and more accessible
**If Approach C wins:** Primary-source-diachronic better for rare words
**If Blend needed:** Combine journal-emphasis (theological) + primary-source (rare)

---

## Status and Next Steps

**Current Status:** Rounds 2-5 refinement complete for Approach A
**Experiments:** 5 words tested (theological, rare, debated, textual)
**Quality:** High (L1-L3 validation 85-100%)
**STAGES.md Conformance:** Partial - needs Round 1 comparison with Approaches B and C

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Design Approaches B and C per STAGES.md v2.0 Stage 1.4
2. Test Approaches B and C on 3-5 words (9-15 runs)
3. Compare all 3 approaches using Stage 2.5 criteria
4. Select winner or blend
5. Proceed to Rounds 7-8 (optimization) or restart Rounds 2-5 if new winner

**Recommendation:**
Retain Approach A experiments as high-quality evidence for journal-emphasis methodology, but complete multi-approach comparison before production deployment.
