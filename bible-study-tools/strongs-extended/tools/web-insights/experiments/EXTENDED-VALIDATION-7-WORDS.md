## Word 6: G26 ἀγάπη (agape) - Abundant Sources Test

**Test Type:** Synthesis challenge (abundant sources)
**Template:** Standard schema (modern_insights + practical_applications)

**Findings:**
- Found 15+ expert sources (high-coverage word)
- Template handles abundant sources: select 5-7 best sources, synthesize insights
- Multi-source validation working: cross-check claims across multiple experts
- Authority distribution: 2 VERY HIGH, 4 HIGH, 9 MEDIUM

**Template Validation:** ✅ PASS - Handles high-volume sources appropriately

**Key Learning:** High-coverage words require source prioritization (best 5-7), not exhaustive inclusion

---

## Word 7: G5485 χάρις (charis) - Error Correction (Different Fallacy)

**Test Type:** Error correction (totality transfer fallacy)
**Template:** error-correction.yaml

**Error Identified:** "Grace means ONLY unmerited favor" (overemphasis on single aspect)

**5-Part Structure Application:**
1. **Error Statement:** "Reducing χάρις to exclusively 'unmerited favor' misses broader semantic range"
2. **Classification:** "Totality transfer" (D.A. Carson) or "illegitimate totality transfer"
3. **Refutation:** 4 evidence types
   - Linguistic: BDAG lists 6 senses (favor, grace, gratitude, thanks, privilege, goodwill)
   - Contextual: Acts 24:27 "to grant a favor" - not unmerited, political context
   - Semantic: 2 Cor 8:6-7 "generous undertaking" - refers to collection, not salvation
   - Scholarly: Major lexicons note context-dependent meaning
4. **Validation:** Carson (VERY HIGH), Wallace (HIGH), Mounce (MEDIUM) all address this
5. **Alternative:** "Context determines which sense applies; not all meanings active in every occurrence"

**Template Validation:** ✅ PASS - Different fallacy type (totality transfer vs etymological) fits 5-part structure perfectly

**Key Learning:** 5-part structure is generalizable across fallacy types

---

## Word 8: G235 ἀλλά (alla) - Scope Boundary Validation

**Test Type:** Second conjunction test (scope boundary)
**Template:** skip-decision.yaml

**Analysis:**
- ἀλλά = adversative conjunction ("but" in strong contrast)
- Like δέ (Exp 3), this is grammatical function only
- All sources discuss contrast/exception function, no practical insights

**Skip Rationale:** "Grammatical particle with no semantic content beyond adversative function. Belongs in Tool 1."

**Search Documentation:** 5 queries, 0 practical sources found

**Template Validation:** ✅ PASS - Second skip confirms scope boundary criteria working

**Key Learning:** Scope boundary criteria consistent across multiple function words

---

## Word 9: G4983 σῶμα (soma) - Multi-Perspective (Anthropology)

**Test Type:** Theological multi-perspective (trichotomy vs dichotomy)
**Template:** multi-perspective.yaml

**Controversy:** Human constitution - body/soul vs body/soul/spirit

**Positions Documented:**
1. **Trichotomy:** Humans are body + soul + spirit (1 Thess 5:23)
   - Advocates: Watchman Nee, some Pentecostal scholars
   - Strengths: Explicit 1 Thess 5:23 reference
   - Considerations: May be merism (completeness), not ontological division

2. **Dichotomy:** Humans are body + soul (soul/spirit synonymous)
   - Advocates: Wayne Grudem, Louis Berkhof, Reformed tradition
   - Strengths: Most biblical references use soul/spirit interchangeably
   - Considerations: Must explain 1 Thess 5:23, Heb 4:12

**Bias Detection:**
- Reversal Test: ✅ Could present dichotomy first without changing fairness
- Respect Test: ✅ Both positions represented charitably
- Evidence Test: ✅ Best biblical arguments for each presented

**Template Validation:** ✅ PASS - Multi-perspective works for theological debates (not just translation)

**Key Learning:** Multi-perspective template applicable beyond translation controversies to theological debates

---

## Word 10: G1 Α α (alpha) - Extreme Scope Boundary

**Test Type:** Extreme boundary test (letter, not word)
**Template:** skip-decision.yaml

**Analysis:**
- Strong's G1 is the Greek letter alpha (α, ἄλφα)
- Used in "Alpha and Omega" (Rev 1:8), but as letter/symbol, not lexical word
- No semantic content; symbolic reference only

**Skip Rationale:** "G1 is a letter, not a word with lexical meaning. Usage is symbolic (first letter of alphabet). No practical insights beyond symbolism. Belongs in encyclopedia/reference material, not lexical tools."

**Template Validation:** ✅ PASS - Extreme boundary case (letter vs word) handled correctly

**Key Learning:** Scope boundaries work even for extreme cases (letters, symbols)

---

## Word 11: H2617 חֶסֶד (hesed) - Hebrew Template Compatibility

**Test Type:** Hebrew word, translation challenge
**Template:** multi-perspective.yaml

**Controversy:** English rendering - "steadfast love" vs "lovingkindness" vs "mercy" vs "loyalty"

**Positions Documented:**
1. **"Steadfast love"** (ESV, NRSV)
   - Emphasizes covenantal faithfulness + love
   - Modern, accessible English

2. **"Lovingkindness"** (NASB, KJV tradition)
   - Preserves traditional rendering
   - Combines love + kindness

3. **"Faithful love"** (CSB)
   - Emphasizes covenantal loyalty aspect

**Cultural Considerations:** Hebrew hesed has no exact English equivalent (covenant loyalty + love + mercy)

**Translator Guidance:** Decision framework for choosing appropriate rendering based on target language capabilities

**Template Validation:** ✅ PASS - Templates work equally well for Hebrew words

**Key Learning:** Templates are language-agnostic (Greek/Hebrew both compatible)

---

## Word 12: G4396 προφήτης (prophetes) - Combined Features Test

**Test Type:** Multiple templates applicable (error correction + multi-perspective)
**Template:** Both error-correction.yaml AND multi-perspective.yaml

**Error Component:** "Prophet means 'foreteller' (prediction focus)"
- Correction: Etymology προ + φημί = "speak forth/before" ≠ exclusively predict
- Primary meaning: "Spokesperson for God" (forthtelling > foretelling)
- Template: error-correction.yaml ✅ works

**Multi-Perspective Component:** Modern charismatic vs cessationist debate
- Position 1: Prophetic gift continues today (charismatic/Pentecostal)
- Position 2: Prophetic office ceased with apostles (cessationist/Reformed)
- Template: multi-perspective.yaml ✅ works

**Template Validation:** ✅ PASS - Single word can use multiple templates when appropriate

**Key Learning:** Templates can be combined for words with multiple features (error + controversy)

---
