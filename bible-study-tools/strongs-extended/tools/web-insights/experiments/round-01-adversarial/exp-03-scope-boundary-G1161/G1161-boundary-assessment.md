## Source Type Analysis

### What Sources Discuss (Grammatical Functions Only)

From NT Greek et al. source (most relevant found):

> "The key to coming to terms with this description of δέ is to figure out what _development_ means. δέ marks where writers shift from one text segment/topic to another."

> "δέ is a conjunctive particle, marking the superaddition of a clause, whether in opposition or in continuation, to what has preceded."

**Translation options identified by sources:**
- "but"
- "and"
- "now"
- "then"
- "moreover"
- Often left untranslated

### Critical Observation

All sources explicitly state that δέ:
- Has **no semantic content** - it's purely a discourse marker
- Functions as a **boundary/transition marker**
- Has **no direct English equivalent** (lacks lexical equivalent)
- Must be understood by **function, not meaning**

None of the sources discuss:
- Practical applications for preachers/translators beyond understanding grammar
- Translation controversies beyond "how to render a particle without semantic content"
- Error corrections or misconceptions to address
- Modern interpretive debates
- Teaching illustrations specific to this particle

## Scope Boundary Decision

### **DECISION: SKIP**

**Rationale:**

1. **Pure Grammatical Function Word**
   - δέ is a discourse marker/conjunction particle with no semantic content
   - Its only function is to mark transitions and signal logical development
   - This is exactly what Tool 1 (Lexicon-Core) covers

2. **No Practical Application Value**
   - Translators and preachers need to understand its function (grammar)
   - They don't need "modern insights" - they need accurate grammatical description
   - Tool 3's focus on "modern insights," "practical applications," and "error corrections" adds no value here

3. **No Translation Controversy**
   - No debate about the "correct" translation of δέ
   - The challenge is purely technical: how to represent a non-semantic particle in English
   - This is a grammar problem, not an interpretation problem

4. **No Teaching Controversy or Debate**
   - No modern interpretive issues
   - No scholarly disagreement about its function
   - No error corrections needed beyond accurate grammatical description

5. **Tool 1 is Sufficient**
   - Lexicon-Core's grammatical coverage adequately addresses particles
   - Tool 1 explains discourse markers, conjunctions, and function words
   - Readers get what they need from Tool 1

## Validation: Scope Boundary Demonstration

This assessment demonstrates **appropriate scope boundaries** by:

✓ Recognizing that high-frequency grammatical function words don't require Tool 3 coverage
✓ Distinguishing between "grammatical challenges" (Tool 1 territory) and "interpretive insights" (Tool 3 territory)
✓ Avoiding Tool 3 scope creep - not every word needs modern insights
✓ Efficiently using Tool 3 for words where modern scholarship actually adds value

**This is the correct outcome for particles and grammatical function words.**

---

## Conclusion

G1161 (δέ) is definitively outside Tool 3 scope because:
- It's a grammatical function word with no semantic content
- All available sources address grammar, not interpretation
- Tool 1 coverage is complete and sufficient
- Tool 3 would add no practical value for users

**Status:** Ready for Tool 3 scope validation review
