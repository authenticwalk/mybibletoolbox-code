# Web Insights - Documentation

## Status
PRODUCTION-READY (All phases complete ✅)

## Overview
Extract insights from vetted web sources to complement lexical research with contemporary scholarship and error corrections.

**Authority Level:** MEDIUM (expert blogs, Ph.D. scholars) to MEDIUM-LOW (M.Div. practitioners)

**Timeline:** 12 weeks total
- Research: 2 weeks ✅
- Experiments: 2 weeks ✅
- Validation: 2 weeks ✅
- Production: 6 weeks

## Methodology (3 Steps)
1. **Source Discovery** - WebSearch across vetted domains (11 sources)
2. **Content Extraction** - WebFetch from vetted sources, verify credentials
3. **Synthesis** - Read Tool 1 first, assign authority level, validate, generate YAML

## Vetted Sources (11 total)
- **MEDIUM-HIGH:** Tyndale House, seminary sites (institutional backing)
- **MEDIUM:** Bill Mounce, scholar blogs (Ph.D. + publications)
- **MEDIUM-LOW:** Qualified practitioners (M.Div. + citations)

## Key Innovations
- **5-Part Error Correction:** Error → Classification → Refutation → Validation → Alternative
- **Multi-Perspective Framework:** Present multiple views fairly
- **Bias Detection Tests:** Reversal, Respect, Evidence
- **Appropriate Skip = Success:** Particles, Tool 1 sufficient coverage

## Experiments Completed (Adversarial Testing)
1. G4151 (pneuma) - Scholarly disagreement → Multi-perspective framework
2. G2160 (eutrapelia) - Rare hapax → Discipline-specific search
3. G1161 (de) - Scope boundary → Skip decision validation
4. G1411 (dynamis) - Error correction → 5-part structure
5. G1577 (ekklesia) - Cultural debate → Bias detection tests

## Coverage Strategy
- **High-Priority (300):** Error corrections, scholarly debates, cultural issues
- **Medium-Priority (800):** Multi-source coverage, translator/preacher guidance
- **Low-Priority (400):** Discipline-specific, opportunistic
- **Skip (~12,500):** Grammatical particles, no expert coverage, Tool 1 sufficient

## Output Format
`.data/strongs/{num}/{num}-web-insights.yaml`
