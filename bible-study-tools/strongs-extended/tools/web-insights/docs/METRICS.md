## Coverage Metrics

**Target Coverage:** 1,500 high-value words (❓ PROJECTED)

**Priority Distribution:**
- **High-Priority (300):** Error corrections, scholarly debates, cultural issues
- **Medium-Priority (800):** Multi-source coverage, translator/preacher guidance
- **Low-Priority (400):** Discipline-specific, opportunistic

- **Cultural debates:** 5-6 hours (bias detection, fair documentation)
- **Error corrections:** 4-5 hours (5-part structure validation)
- **Grammatical particles:** Skip = success (Tool 1 sufficient)

## Innovation Validation

### 5-Part Error Correction
**Status:** ✅ VALIDATED (tested on G1411 δύναμις)

**Structure:**
1. Error statement (clear identification)
2. Classification (folk etymology, theological error, etc.)
3. Refutation (multi-layered with evidence)
4. Expert validation (authority verification)
5. Correct alternative (positive guidance)

**Result:** Pedagogically sound, gracious tone, multi-source validation

### Multi-Perspective Framework
**Status:** ✅ VALIDATED (tested on G4151 πνεῦμα, G1577 ἐκκλησία)

**Approach:**
- Present all major scholarly positions fairly
- Document evidence for each view
- Apply bias detection tests (Reversal, Respect, Evidence)
- No artificial resolution (respect genuine debate)

**Result:** Passes 3 bias tests, maintains scholarly integrity

### Bias Detection Tests
**Status:** ✅ VALIDATED (tested on G1577 ἐκκλησία)

**Tests:**
1. **Reversal Test:** Would author present opposing view fairly if positions reversed?
2. **Respect Test:** Does documentation show respect for all perspectives?
3. **Evidence Test:** Is evidence-strength honestly represented?

**Result:** Framework maintains neutrality, documents debates fairly

### Appropriate Skip = Success
**Status:** ✅ VALIDATED (tested on G1161 δέ)

**Pattern:** Grammatical particles with sufficient Tool 1 coverage → Skip is correct decision

**Result:** Scope boundary validation, resource efficiency
