# Surface Realization: Bible Translation Guide

> **Parent Context:** Practical guidance for translators working with surface realization (noun/pronoun/zero/clitic) in Bible translation projects.

## The Four Translation Problems

### Problem 1: The Holy Spirit Reference Problem

**Challenge**: Maintaining reference to the Holy Spirit across clauses in different pro-drop systems

**Greek source pattern**: "To pneuma ho hagios" → Often understood with dropped pronouns in following clauses

**Translation choices by language type**:

**English (non-pro-drop)**:
- Must use explicit forms: "The Holy Spirit" (noun) or "He" (pronoun)
- Cannot use zero without sounding ungrammatical
- Example: "The Holy Spirit descended. He remained on him."

**Spanish (pro-drop)**:
- Three options available: "El Espíritu Santo" (noun), "Él" (pronoun), or "[∅]" (zero)
- Most natural: "El Espíritu Santo descendió. [∅] Permaneció sobre él."
- Explicit pronouns sound emphatic/redundant

**Japanese (high pro-drop)**:
- Extensive zero use possible
- "聖霊が降った。[∅] 彼の上に留まった。"
- Zero is unmarked, natural choice

**Translation principle**: Match target language pro-drop patterns, not source language or English intermediate translation.

### Problem 2: Theological Ambiguity from Zero Subjects

**Challenge**: Source language zero subjects create intentional ambiguity that translation must handle

**Example - Romans 10:9** (Greek has ambiguous subject):

**Greek**: "...ὁ θεὸς αὐτὸν ἤγειρεν ἐκ νεκρῶν..." (God him raised from dead)
- Subject could be: God raised Jesus, OR God raised us, OR God raised the dead generally
- Zero subject in relative clause allows theological flexibility

**Translation impacts**:

**Pro-drop languages** (Spanish, Greek, Hebrew):
- Can preserve ambiguity: "[∅] resucitó de entre los muertos"
- Reader interprets based on theological context
- Maintains original openness

**Non-pro-drop languages** (English, German):
- Must disambiguate: "God raised him from the dead"
- Forced to choose referent explicitly
- Loses original ambiguity (theological interpretation now fixed)

**Translation principle**: When source uses zero for theological ambiguity, preserve in pro-drop targets but document forced disambiguation in non-pro-drop targets.

### Problem 3: The Clitic Object Problem

**Challenge**: Romance languages use clitics for objects, fundamentally changing word order and information structure

**Spanish/Italian/Portuguese patterns**:

**Full object NP**:
```
English: "He told them the story"
Spanish: "Les contó la historia a ellos" (to-them told the story to them)
         ^ clitic                        ^ full NP (optional)
```

**Clitic only** (most common):
```
Spanish: "Les contó la historia" (to-them told the story)
         ^ clitic doubles object
```

**Double clitics**:
```
Spanish: "Se la contó" (to-them it told)
         ^ ^  Both object and indirect object as clitics
```

**Translation choices**:
1. **Full object NP**: "a ellos" (to them) - emphatic, contrastive
2. **Clitic**: "les" - neutral, most natural
3. **Zero**: Only in limited contexts (previously mentioned, highly accessible)

**Bible translation application**:

**Narrative** ("Jesus told them..."):
- Use clitic: "Jesús les dijo..."
- Natural, unmarked choice

**Emphasis** ("He told THEM, not us"):
- Full NP + clitic: "Les dijo a ellos, no a nosotros"
- Clitic + full NP = emphasis

**Question**: Many pro-drop languages with clitics require clitic even when full NP present (clitic doubling). This is NOT redundant—grammatically required.

### Problem 4: Switching Between Realization Types

**Challenge**: Bible discourse naturally switches between surface types; translators must maintain consistency within target language constraints

**Biblical discourse pattern**:
```
"A woman came to the well."           [Noun - First Mention]
"She drank water."                    [Pronoun - Routine, English]
"[∅] Returned to her home."           [Zero - Would be natural in Spanish]
"Jesus asked the woman..."            [Noun - Restaging]
```

**Translation considerations by language**:

**English (non-pro-drop)**:
- Must use pronoun for all routine reference
- Cannot use zero except in coordination ("She came and [∅] drank")
- Higher pronoun density than source languages

**Spanish (pro-drop)**:
- Can use zero for routine reference
- Sounds more natural than English pronoun overload
- "Una mujer vino al pozo. [∅] Bebió agua. [∅] Volvió a su casa."

**Greek source (pro-drop)**:
- Likely used zero for routine reference
- Explicit pronouns signal emphasis
- English translation may lose emphasis distinction

**Translation principle**:
1. Identify source language emphasis (explicit pronoun in pro-drop source = emphasis)
2. Map to target language system (preserve emphasis if possible)
3. Use target language defaults for unmarked reference (zero in pro-drop, pronoun in non-pro-drop)

## Discourse Factors Affecting Translation

### 1. Genre and Register

**Impact on surface realization**:

**Narrative** (Genesis, Gospels):
- Higher noun usage for participant introduction
- Routine reference follows language defaults (zero/pronoun)
- Dialogue within narrative: More pronouns for clarity

**Prophetic/Poetic** (Isaiah, Psalms):
- More ellipsis (grammatical omission)
- May use zero even in non-pro-drop languages (poetic license)
- Emphasis through explicit pronouns common

**Epistles** (Paul's letters):
- Formal register → More nouns
- Less zero even in pro-drop languages
- Explicit references for clarity

**Direct Speech** (dialogue):
- Clarity prioritized
- More pronouns (even in pro-drop languages)
- Emphasis through prosody (hard to capture in writing)

---

### 2. Participant Tracking and Surface Realization

**First Mention** (introducing character):
- **Always use noun** (all languages)
- Indefinite marking common: "A man", "A prophet"
- Sets up referent for subsequent tracking

**Routine Reference** (continuing with same participant):
- **Pro-drop languages**: Zero (most natural)
- **Non-pro-drop**: Pronoun (required)
- Distance factor: Further from antecedent → Prefer pronoun/noun

**Restaging** (reintroducing after absence):
- **Use noun** (all languages)
- Definite marking: "The man", "The prophet"
- Signals shift back to previously mentioned participant

**Ambiguity** (multiple same-gender referents):
- **Use noun for disambiguation** (all languages)
- Cannot rely on pronoun (unclear referent)
- "Peter told James" not "He told him"

---

### 3. Distance from Antecedent

**Impact on surface form choice**:

**Adjacent clauses** (0-1 clause away):
- Pro-drop: Zero most natural
- Non-pro-drop: Unstressed pronoun
- Example: "Jesus came. [∅/He] Taught in the temple."

**Nearby** (2-3 clauses):
- Pro-drop: Pronoun or zero (depends on salience)
- Non-pro-drop: Pronoun (required)
- Noun possible if ambiguous

**Distant** (4+ clauses):
- All languages: Prefer noun for clarity
- Pronoun possible if highly salient (Jesus, God)
- Zero only for most salient participants (pro-drop languages)

---

### 4. Saliency and Topicality

**Highly salient participants** (Jesus, God, main character):
- Can use reduced forms even at distance
- Pro-drop: Zero acceptable further from antecedent
- Non-pro-drop: Pronoun acceptable further from antecedent

**Secondary participants** (disciples, crowds):
- Require more explicit marking
- Distance threshold lower (need noun sooner)
- Ambiguity risk higher (use noun for clarity)

**Inanimate referents** (objects, abstract concepts):
- Generally require more explicit marking
- Zero less common (even in pro-drop)
- Demonstratives common: "this thing", "that matter"

---

## Translation Strategy Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Source Language

1. **Identify pro-drop status of source** (Greek/Hebrew = pro-drop)
2. **Locate explicit pronouns in source**
   - If explicit pronoun in pro-drop source → Likely emphasis
   - Mark for emphasis preservation in target
3. **Track participant states** (first mention, routine, restaging)
4. **Note discourse distance and saliency**

### Step 2: Analyze Target Language

1. **Determine pro-drop status of target**
   - Consult language typology databases
   - Check verb agreement richness
   - Consult native speakers for naturalness
2. **Identify clitic systems** (if Romance/Balkan/Slavic)
3. **Check honorific/formality systems** (if Asian/Austronesian)
4. **Note switch-reference systems** (if Papuan/Mayan)

### Step 3: Map Surface Realizations

**For each referent in source**:

1. **Check participant tracking state**:
   - First Mention → **Noun** (all languages)
   - Routine → Check pro-drop status
   - Restaging → **Noun** (all languages)

2. **For routine reference**:
   - **Target is pro-drop**: Use **Zero** (unless emphasis needed)
   - **Target is non-pro-drop**: Use **Pronoun** (required)

3. **Check for emphasis/disambiguation**:
   - Source has explicit pronoun (when zero expected) → Preserve emphasis in target
   - Multiple referents present → Use **Noun** for clarity

4. **Consider register/formality**:
   - Formal contexts → Prefer nouns over pronouns
   - Informal contexts → Follow language defaults (zero/pronoun)

### Step 4: Validate Naturalness

1. **Check with native speakers**: Does this sound natural?
2. **Test comprehension**: Is referent clear at each point?
3. **Compare to existing translations** in target language
4. **Adjust for discourse flow**: Does switching between forms feel natural?

## Common Translation Mistakes

### Mistake 1: English-Based Assumptions

**Error**: Using English translation as basis for target language decisions

**Problem**:
- English is non-pro-drop (always explicit)
- English masks emphasis in source (Greek/Hebrew explicit pronouns)
- Cannot tell routine vs emphatic from English alone

**Solution**: Always check original Greek/Hebrew, not English intermediate

---

### Mistake 2: Over-Using Pronouns in Pro-Drop Languages

**Error**: Spanish "Él vino. Él compró. Él fue." (He came. He bought. He went.)

**Problem**: Sounds unnatural, emphatic, or child-like to native speakers

**Solution**: Use zero for routine reference: "[∅] Vino. [∅] Compró. [∅] Fue."

---

### Mistake 3: Under-Restaging in Pro-Drop Languages

**Error**: Using zero when participant returns after absence

**Problem**: Reader loses track of who is being discussed

**Solution**: Use full noun at restaging: "Juan vino" (not "[∅] vino") after absence

---

### Mistake 4: Missing Emphasis Markers

**Error**: Treating all Greek pronouns as routine (translatable as zero in pro-drop)

**Problem**: Loses emphasis present in source

**Solution**: Check if Greek pronoun is expected or emphatic; preserve emphasis

---

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Clitic Requirements

**Error**: Omitting clitics in Romance languages: *"Dijo la historia" (told the story)

**Problem**: Ungrammatical without clitic for indirect object

**Solution**: Use required clitic: "Les dijo la historia" (to-them told the story)

---

## Testing Translation Quality

### Naturalness Test (Native Speaker Judgment)

**Questions for native speakers**:
1. Does this sound like natural [language] to you?
2. Is it clear who is being talked about at each point?
3. Do the pronouns/nouns feel appropriate for the register?
4. Are there any places that sound awkward or unnatural?

**Red flags**:
- "Sounds like a translation" (following source/English too closely)
- "Confusing who is being talked about" (under-marking)
- "Repetitive" or "child-like" (over-marking in pro-drop)
- "Too formal" or "too casual" (register mismatch)

### Comprehension Test

**Method**: Read translation aloud, ask listener to identify referents

**Success criteria**:
- Listener correctly identifies all participants
- No confusion at participant switches
- Emphasis points recognized (if marked)

**Common failures**:
- Ambiguous pronoun reference (multiple same-gender referents)
- Lost track after restaging (insufficient marking)
- Emphasis missed (treated as routine)

### Comparison with Existing Translations

**Check**:
- How do existing quality translations handle same passages?
- What surface realization patterns do they use?
- Where do they use nouns vs pronouns vs zero?

**Note**: Existing translations may not be perfect, but patterns reveal target language norms.

## Language-Specific Guidance

**Pro-drop languages** (Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Turkish):
- Default to zero for routine reference
- Use explicit pronouns only for emphasis/disambiguation
- Higher noun usage in formal registers

**Non-pro-drop languages** (English, French, German, Dutch):
- Pronouns required for routine reference (grammatical)
- Cannot use zero (except coordinated ellipsis)
- Emphasis through stress, word order, or clefts ("It is HE who...")

**Clitic languages** (Romance, Balkan, some Slavic):
- Clitics required in most contexts (grammatical)
- Clitic + full NP = emphasis (not redundancy)
- Special ordering rules (consult language-specific grammar)

**Switch-reference languages** (Papuan, Mayan):
- Zero allowed with same-subject (SS) marking
- Explicit marking with different-subject (DS)
- Cannot violate switch-reference constraints
