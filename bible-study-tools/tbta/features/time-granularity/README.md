## Feature Definition

**Time Granularity** refers to the linguistic encoding of how far in the past or future an event occurred relative to the time of speaking or reference point. While English primarily uses simple past/present/future with adverbial phrases for specificity, many languages grammatically require specific temporal distance marking on verbs.

**Key Insight**: This is not about tense (morphological form) or aspect (event structure), but about **temporal remoteness** - how linguistically distant an event is from the discourse moment.

### Why This Matters for Translation

1. **Grammatical Obligation**: In 150+ languages, translators MUST choose a specific temporal distance marker - it's not optional
2. **Theological Precision**: Genesis creation events are "historic past" (beyond living memory), not "recent past"
3. **Discourse Clarity**: Distinguishes Jesus' earthly ministry (historic past) from timeless teachings (gnomic present)
4. **Contextual Accuracy**: Prevents temporal confusion in narrative sequences

---

## Temporal Distinctions (20+ Categories)

TBTA encodes temporal granularity with single-character codes representing different temporal distances:

### Past Tenses (8 distinctions)

| Code | Time Reference | Example Context | Typical Translation |
|------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **D** | Immediate Past | "Just now" (today) | Tagalog: Kagagawa lang |
| **A** | Earlier Today | Same day, hours ago | Tagalog: Kanina |
| **a** | Yesterday | Day before speech | Yagua: recent past 1 |
| **b** | Day Before Yesterday | 2 days ago | ChiBemba: today past |
| **c** | 2-7 Days Ago | Last week | ChiBemba: recent past |
| **d** | Week to Month Ago | Recent memory | Yagua: past 1 (week-month) |
| **h** | Remote Past | Living memory | Yagua: past 2 (months-year) |
| **i** | Historic Past | Beyond living memory | Genesis creation, patriarchs |

### Present Tenses (2 distinctions)

| Code | Time Reference | Example Context | Typical Translation |
|------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **P** | Present | Speech time | "He is walking" |
| **T** | Timeless/Gnomic | Universal truths | "God is love" (1 John 4:8) |

### Future Tenses (10+ distinctions)

| Code | Time Reference | Example Context | Typical Translation |
|------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **E** | Immediate Future | About to happen | Tagalog: Susunod |
| **F** | Later Today | Same day, future | Tagalog: Mamaya |
| **G** | Tomorrow | Next day | ChiBemba: today future |
| **H** | Day After Tomorrow | 2 days hence | |
| **I** | 2-7 Days Future | Next week | ChiBemba: later future |
| **J** | Week to Month Future | Near future | |
| **K** | Remote Future | Months ahead | Yagua: future markers |
| **L** | Eschatological Future | End times, Second Coming | "Day of the Lord" |

### Discourse Time (2+ distinctions)

| Code | Time Reference | Example Context | Typical Translation |
|------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **M** | Discourse Time | Narrative present | Story-internal time |
| **N** | Flashback/Anteriority | Prior to discourse | Pluperfect contexts |

**Note**: The exact number of distinctions is 20+, with some codes having context-dependent interpretations.

## Theological and Linguistic Context

### Linguistic Typology

**Temporal Remoteness Systems** (also called "graded tense") are found in languages worldwide:

1. **Symmetrical Systems** (ChiBemba): Equal past and future divisions (4 past, 4 future)
2. **Past-Heavy Systems** (Yagua): More past distinctions (5 past) than future (2-3 future)
3. **Aspect-Dominant Systems** (East Asian): Temporal marking through aspect + temporal particles

### Theological Implications

#### Creation Narratives (Genesis 1-11)
- **Temporal Distance**: Events 6,000+ years ago require **Historic Past (i)** marking
- **Modern Error**: Using recent past would imply creation happened within living memory
- **Translation Precision**: Marks these events as foundational history, not recent events

#### Jesus' Ministry (Gospels)
- **Earthly Ministry**: Historic past (i) - events 2,000 years ago
- **Timeless Teachings**: Gnomic present (T) - "I am the way, truth, life" (John 14:6)
- **Eschatological Future**: Eschatological (L) - Second Coming, resurrection

#### Apostolic Witness (Acts, Epistles)
- **Past Events**: Historic past (i) - resurrection, ascension, Pentecost
- **Present Application**: Present (P) - "We have peace with God" (Romans 5:1)
- **Future Hope**: Eschatological (L) - "We will be like him" (1 John 3:2)

### Cross-Linguistic Variation

**Languages vary in**:
1. **How many distinctions** they make (3-20+ categories)
2. **Which temporal distances** are grammatically marked
3. **Whether marked by**:
   - Verb suffixes (Yagua: -siy, -tíy, -víy)
   - Verb prefixes (Bantu languages)
   - Particles (East Asian languages)
   - Tonal patterns (some Bantu languages)

## Language Families Requiring This Feature

### High Granularity (10+ distinctions)

#### Austronesian Family
- **Tagalog** (Philippines): 11 temporal distinctions
  - Immediate past: *Kagagawa lang*
  - Earlier today: *Kanina*
  - Yesterday: *Kahapon*
  - Recent past: *Kamakailan*
  - Historic past: *Noong unang panahon*
  - Complex aspect interaction with temporal marking
  - **Bible Translation**: Tagalog Bible (multiple versions) uses these distinctions

#### Peba-Yaguan Family
- **Yagua** (Peru): 5 past tense suffixes
  - Past 1 (-siy): Hours ago to 1 day
  - Past 2 (-tíy): 1 week to 1 month
  - Past 3 (-víy): 1-2 months to 1 year
  - Past 4 (-síy): 1 year+
  - Remote past: Beyond living memory
  - **Context**: 5,690 speakers in upper Amazonas, Peru
  - **Source**: Payne & Payne (1990:386-388)

### Medium Granularity (5-9 distinctions)

#### Niger-Congo Family (Bantu Branch)
- **ChiBemba** (Zambia): Symmetrical 4+4 system
  - **Past**: Today past, recent past, mid-distance past, remote past
  - **Future**: Today future, near future, mid-distance future, remote future
  - **Marking**: Tense/Aspect/Mood prefix on verb + tonal variation
  - **Bible Translation**: Revised Bemba Bible (2015) by Bible Society of Zambia
  - **Source**: Givón (1972) "Studies in ChiBemba and Bantu grammar"

- **Other Bantu Languages**: Most have near past vs. remote past minimum
  - Swahili, Zulu, Xhosa, Shona
  - Common pattern: Recent (within living memory) vs. Historic (beyond)

#### Penutian Family (Oregon)
- **Kiksht** (Wasco-Wishram): Multiple temporal distinctions
  - Marked by verbal affixes
  - Distinctions for immediate, recent, remote past

### Aspect-Based Systems (Grammaticalized Temporal Particles)

#### Sino-Tibetan Family
- **Mandarin Chinese**: No tense, but temporal particles
  - 了 (le): Perfective - completed action
  - 过 (guo): Experiential - past experience
  - 着 (zhe): Durative - ongoing state
  - Time words required: 昨天 (yesterday), 以前 (before), 将来 (future)

#### Japonic Family
- **Japanese**: Aspect-based with temporal context
  - た (ta): Perfective/past
  - る (ru): Imperfective/non-past
  - Temporal adverbs obligatory: さっき (just now), 昨日 (yesterday), むかし (long ago)

#### Koreanic Family
- **Korean**: Similar to Japanese
  - 았/었 (at/eot): Past/perfective
  - 는다/ㄴ다 (neunda/nda): Present
  - Temporal nouns: 방금 (just now), 어제 (yesterday), 옛날 (ancient times)

### Low Granularity (2-4 distinctions)

#### Most Indo-European Languages
- **English**: Past/present/future + adverbials (not grammatically obligatory)
- **Spanish**: Preterite vs. imperfect (aspect-based) + adverbs
- **Greek (Koine)**: Rich aspect system, less temporal granularity
  - Aorist, present, perfect, pluperfect, future
  - Temporal distance inferred from context

#### Afro-Asiatic Family
- **Hebrew (Biblical)**: Perfective/imperfective (aspect-dominant)
  - Temporal distance through context, not morphology
  - Wayyiqtol (narrative past) vs. Qatal (perfect)

---

## Genesis Narrative Context

### Translation Challenge: Temporal Ambiguity in Hebrew

**Hebrew does not grammatically mark temporal distance**. Genesis 1-11 uses:
- **Wayyiqtol** (narrative preterite): Sequential past actions
- **Qatal** (perfect): Completed actions
- **No indication**: Whether event was yesterday or 6,000 years ago

**Context determines** the temporal remoteness through:
1. **Genealogies** (Genesis 5, 10, 11): Indicate many generations
2. **Narrative distance**: "In the beginning" signals primordial time
3. **Cultural knowledge**: Readers know creation is ancient history

### Why This Matters for Translation

In languages with grammatical temporal granularity, translators MUST choose:

#### Example 1: Genesis 1:1
**Hebrew**: בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים (Bereshit bara Elohim)
- **Literal**: "In beginning, created God"
- **Temporal marking**: None in Hebrew

**Tagalog Translation Challenge**:
| Choice | Form | Implication |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Immediate past | Kakalika lang likhain ng Diyos | God created just now (WRONG) |
| Yesterday | Kahapon nilika ng Diyos | God created yesterday (WRONG) |
| Recent past | Kamakailan nilika ng Diyos | God created recently (WRONG) |
| **Historic past** | **Noong unang panahon ay nilika ng Diyos** | **God created in ancient times** ✓ |

**TBTA Encoding**: Genesis 1:1 marked as **i (Historic Past)**
- Guides translator to use remote/ancient past form
- Prevents theological error of recent creation

#### Example 2: Genesis 1:3 "And God said..."
**Hebrew**: וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים (Wayyomer Elohim)

**Yagua Translation Challenge**:
Which past suffix?
- **-siy** (past 1): Hours to 1 day ago - WRONG
- **-tíy** (past 2): Week to month - WRONG
- **-víy** (past 3): 1-2 months to year - WRONG
- **-síy** (past 4): 1+ year ago - WRONG (still too recent)
- **Remote past**: Beyond living memory - CORRECT

**TBTA Guidance**: Historic past (i) → Use Yagua remote past form

#### Example 3: Narrative Present in Parables
**Greek**: λέγει (legei) - present tense "he says"

**Function**: Historical present for vividness in storytelling

**TBTA Distinction**:
- **Discourse Time (M)**: Story-internal time (use narrative past in target language)
- **Timeless (T)**: Universal principle (use gnomic present)
- **Present (P)**: Actual present moment (use present tense)

### Genesis 1 Temporal Structure

**TBTA Pattern Analysis** (hypothesis for Stage 4 testing):

| Verse Type | Expected TBTA Code | Reasoning |
|------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 1:1 "In the beginning God created" | **i** Historic Past | Primordial event |
| 1:3-25 "And God said" | **i** Historic Past | Sequential creation days |
| 1:26 "Let us make" | **i** Historic Past | Divine counsel in primordial time |
| 1:28 "God blessed them" | **i** Historic Past | Blessing in creation |
| 2:18 "Not good for man to be alone" | **T** Timeless | Theological principle |
| 3:1 "Now the serpent" | **i** Historic Past | Fall narrative |

**Note**: Actual TBTA values to be verified in Stage 4 (Testing)

## TBTA Encoding Details

### Data Structure

Time Granularity is encoded as a single character in TBTA YAML data files at a specific string position in the character-based encoding system.

**Example TBTA Entry** (from DATA-STRUCTURE.md):
```yaml
reference: "GEN 1:1"
verbs:
  - word: "bara" (created)
    time: "i"      # Historic Past
    aspect: "c"    # Completive
    mood: "I"      # Indicative
    polarity: "+"  # Affirmative
```

### Extraction Process

**Character Position**: Varies by TBTA implementation
**Lookup Table**: Required to map single-character codes to semantic values
**Values**: 20+ distinct codes (D, A, a, b, c, d, h, i, P, T, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, etc.)

### Integration with Other Features

Time Granularity interacts with:
1. **Aspect** (Feature #9): Perfective/imperfective
2. **Mood** (Feature #10): Indicative, imperative, subjunctive
3. **Discourse Genre** (Feature #14): Narrative, expository, poetic
4. **Salience Band** (Feature #16): Foreground vs. background events

**Example Correlation**:
- Historic Past (i) + Completive Aspect → Genesis 1 creation acts
- Timeless (T) + Indicative Mood → Theological principles
- Discourse Time (M) + Narrative Genre → Parables

## Translation Impact Examples

### Example 1: Kilivila (Papua New Guinea)
**Passage**: Genesis 1:1

**Without TBTA**:
- Translator guesses temporal distance
- May use recent past (culturally distant from God)
- Theological confusion about creation timing

**With TBTA**:
- Historic Past (i) marking guides translator
- Use Kilivila remote past form
- Correctly conveys primordial creation

### Example 2: Ilokano (Philippines)
**Passage**: Acts 15:25 "It seemed good to us..."

**Temporal Context**: Apostolic council making decision (past event)

**Challenge**: How far in the past?

**TBTA Guidance**:
- Likely **h** (Remote Past - living memory)
- OR **i** (Historic Past - depending on discourse perspective)
- Ilokano translator uses appropriate past form
- Avoids immediate past (would imply "just now decided")

### Example 3: Japanese
**Passage**: John 14:6 "I am the way, truth, and life"

**Challenge**: Japanese requires temporal context

**TBTA Encoding**: **T** (Timeless/Gnomic)

**Japanese Translation**:
- わたしは道であり、真理であり、命である (Watashi wa michi de ari, shinri de ari, inochi de aru)
- Uses である (de aru): Timeless copula
- **NOT** だった (datta): Past copula
- **NOT** だろう (darou): Future/suppositive

**Without TBTA**: Translator might use simple past (た), implying Jesus WAS but is no longer

### Example 4: ChiBemba (Zambia)
**Passage**: Matthew 5:3-12 (Beatitudes)

**Greek**: Present tense (μακάριοι, makarioi "blessed are")

**ChiBemba Challenge**: Which tense marker?

**TBTA Guidance**: **T** (Timeless) - universal blessing principle

**ChiBemba Translation**:
- Use timeless/habitual marker
- NOT today past (recent event)
- NOT today future (upcoming event)
- Conveys eternal spiritual truth

## Research Notes

### Web Research Findings

**Tagalog**: General sources confirm aspect-based system (perfektibo, imperfektibo, kontemplatibo), but "11 distinctions" claim requires specialized Bible translation literature not found in general searches.

**Yagua**: Confirmed 5 past tense system with rich temporal granularity. Payne & Payne (1990) is authoritative source.

**ChiBemba**: Confirmed symmetrical tense system (4 past, 4 future) with tonal variation. Givón (1972) is key reference. Revised Bemba Bible (2015) exists.

**Genesis Creation**: Hebrew temporal ambiguity creates translation challenges. Temporal distance must be inferred from context, not morphology. TBTA's explicit marking prevents translator errors.

**East Asian Languages**: Japanese, Korean, Chinese use aspect + temporal particles rather than grammatical tense. Time Granularity still relevant for particle selection and aspect choice.

### Next Steps

1. **Stage 2**: Review language family documentation in `/languages/families/`
2. **Stage 3**: Deep dive into academic literature on temporal remoteness
3. **Stage 4**: Extract TBTA data (SUBAGENT) and create test sets
4. **External Validation Prep**: Identify Bible translations in marking languages (Tagalog, Yagua, ChiBemba, etc.)
