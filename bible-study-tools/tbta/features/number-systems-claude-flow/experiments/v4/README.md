# V4: Macula Morphology Investigation

**Status**: Abandoned - Wrong approach
**Accuracy**: N/A (not implemented)

## Discovery

TBTA Number feature tracks **semantic participants** (who/what is referenced), NOT grammatical number of Greek/Hebrew words.

### Evidence: LUK.005.002

**Macula Greek morphology**:
- "fishermen" (ἁλεεῖς) = grammatical PLURAL

**TBTA annotation**:
- "person" (the fishermen) = **Paucal** (small group)
- "boat" (two boats) = **Dual** (exactly 2)

**Conclusion**: Greek grammar says "plural", but TBTA says "Paucal" because it's tracking the NUMBER OF PEOPLE FISHING (a few), not the grammatical form.

## Why Macula Doesn't Help

1. **Greek has no dual number** - Lost in Koine period
2. **TBTA annotates referents, not grammar** - "Who is being talked about?" not "What form is the word?"
3. **Semantic vs grammatical mismatch** - Need to understand MEANING, not just MORPHOLOGY

## What Would Help

1. **Hebrew dual morphology** (OT only) - Hebrew preserves dual endings
2. **TBTA annotation guidelines** - What is their criteria?
3. **Translation consensus** - Languages with number systems show the intended meaning

## Recommendation

Skip v4. Return to improving v2 with better English text analysis.
