# Translation Agreement Analysis - GEN 1:26

**Date**: 2025-11-20
**TBTA Annotation**: God = **Trial** (First Person Inclusive)
**Translations Analyzed**: 360 languages via quote-bible skill

## Languages with Trial/Dual Number Systems

### Available in Quote-Bible Data

| Language | Code | Trial? | Dual? | Translation | Pronoun Used | Matches TBTA? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tongan** | ton-ton | ❌ | ✅ | "Ke tau ngaohi" | "tau" (plural 3+) | ⚠️ DISAGREES |
| **Pohnpeian** | pon-2006 | ❌ | ✅ | "kitail pahn wiahda" | "kitail" (plural) | ⚠️ DISAGREES |
| **Tok Pisin** | tpi-tpi | ✅ | ✅ | "Nau yumi wokim" | "yumi" (ambiguous) | ⚠️ DISAGREES |
| **Māori** | mri | ❌ | ✅ | "Kia hanga tatou" | "tatou" (plural 3+) | ⚠️ DISAGREES |

### NOT Available in Data
- **Samoan** (smo) - Has trial
- **Fijian** (fij) - Has trial
- **Slovenian** (slv) - Has dual
- **Upper Sorbian** (hsb) - Has dual

## Key Findings

### 1. Tok Pisin - Has Trial But Didn't Use It

**Expected**: "yumitripela" (we three inclusive - explicit trial)
**Actual**: "yumi" (we inclusive - ambiguous for 2, 3, or many)

**Problem**: Translator chose ambiguous form over explicit trial pronoun!

### 2. Tongan - No Trial, Used Plural 3+

**System**: Singular, Dual, Plural (3+)
**Used**: "tau" = first person inclusive plural (3 or more)
**Could mean**: Either Trial (exactly 3) OR Plural (3+)

**Cannot distinguish**: "tau" matches both TBTA Trial AND TBTA Plural!

### 3. Pohnpeian - No Trial, Used Plural

**System**: Singular, Dual, Plural
**Used**: "kitail" = first person inclusive plural
**Meaning**: Same issue as Tongan - ambiguous between Trial and Plural

## Critical Problem: Translation Optionality

Even when trial pronouns EXIST (Tok Pisin), translators may choose:
1. **Ambiguous forms** ("yumi" instead of "yumitripela")
2. **Theological reasons** (Trinity interpretation ambiguous)
3. **Dynamic equivalence** (natural flow over grammatical precision)

## Why V5 Translation Agreement Fails

### Insufficient Data
1. Only **1 language with trial** in dataset (Tok Pisin)
2. That language **didn't use trial** in GEN 1:26
3. No dual-only languages available (Slovenian, Sorbian absent)

### Translator Inconsistency
1. Optional marking: Trial may be grammatically possible but pragmatically rare
2. Theological ambiguity: Translators may avoid committing to Trinity vs council
3. Date effects: Older translations before pronoun standardization

### Fundamental Mismatch
1. **TBTA tracks semantic participants**: "How many beings involved?"
2. **Translations track theological interpretation**: "Should we signal Trinity?"
3. These are DIFFERENT questions with potentially different answers

## Comparison to TBTA

**TBTA says**: Trial (exactly 3 divine persons - Trinity)

**Translations say**:
- Tongan: Plural 3+ (could be Trinity OR divine council)
- Tok Pisin: Ambiguous (could be 2, 3, or many)
- Pohnpeian: Plural (3+)

**Agreement level**: 0% explicit trial marking (0/4 languages)

### 4. Māori - No Trial, Used Plural 3+

**System**: Singular, Dual ("tāua" we two), Plural ("tātou" we 3+)
**Used**: "tatou" = first person inclusive plural (3 or more)
**Could mean**: Either Trial (exactly 3) OR Plural (3+)

**Cannot distinguish**: Same problem as Tongan!

## Implications for v5 Approach

**Translation agreement cannot establish TBTA ground truth** because:
1. Translators don't consistently use available grammatical distinctions
2. Theological interpretation influences pronoun choice
3. Need multiple languages - only have 1 with trial
4. That 1 language didn't use trial in the test case

**Conclusion**: V5 approach ABANDONED - insufficient data + translator inconsistency
