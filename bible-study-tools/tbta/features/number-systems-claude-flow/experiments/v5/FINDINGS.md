# V5 Findings: Tok Pisin Translation Analysis

## GEN 1:26 (Trinity Context, TBTA = Trial)

**Tok Pisin Translation**:
```
Bihain God i tok olsem, "Nau yumi wokim ol manmeri bai ol i kamap olsem yumi yet..."
```

**English**: "Then God said, 'Now we make the people so they become like us...'"

### Pronoun Analysis

**Used**: "yumi" (inclusive first person)

**Tok Pisin Pronoun System**:
- mi = I
- yumi = we (inclusive, ambiguous number - could be 2, 3, or many)
- yumitupela = we two (inclusive dual)
- yumitripela = we three (inclusive trial) ← **NOT used**
- yumipela = we (inclusive plural, many)

## Critical Problem

**The translator used "yumi" (ambiguous) instead of "yumitripela" (trial)!**

This means:
1. Even in trial-marking languages, translators may not use trial consistently
2. "yumi" could mean 2, 3, or many - doesn't reveal TBTA's Trial annotation
3. Translation choice doesn't match TBTA semantic annotation

## Why This Happens

Possible reasons:
1. **Theological ambiguity**: Translator unsure if Trinity or divine council
2. **Grammatical optionality**: Trial pronouns may be optional in Tok Pisin
3. **Translation philosophy**: Dynamic equivalence vs formal correspondence
4. **Date of translation**: Older translations before trial became standardized

## Implications for V5 Hypothesis

**MAJOR SETBACK**: Translation agreement approach requires:
- Multiple languages with trial/dual (only have Tok Pisin)
- Consistent use of number marking (not happening)
- Agreement threshold (can't establish with 1 language)

**Hypothesis Status**: Questionable without multiple trial-marking languages

## Next Steps

1. Check if any other eBible languages have trial/dual
2. See if Tok Pisin uses trial ANYWHERE in the Bible
3. Consider abandoning v5 if insufficient data
