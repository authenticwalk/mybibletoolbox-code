# Arbitrarity Classification for Number System Feature

**Feature**: number-systems
**Default Classification**: arbitrary

**Principle**: Most number choices in the Bible are straightforward and theologically neutral. Only mark as non-arbitrary when the specific number choice affects doctrine, divine speech interpretation, church practice, or denominational theology.

---

## Non-Arbitrary Contexts

### 1. Trinity References (Gen 1:26, Gen 1:27, Gen 11:7)

**Verse Pattern**: Genesis 1:26 "Let us make mankind in our image"

**Affected Values**: Trial (exactly 3) vs Plural (3+/many)

**Theological Stakes**: **HIGH**

**Affected Doctrines**:
- Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit)
- Nature of God (one God, three persons)
- Creation theology (who participated in creation)

**Denominational Implications**: Yes - all major Christian traditions unified on Trinity

**Cultural Sensitivity**:
- Polytheistic background communities may misunderstand plural as multiple gods
- Islamic/Jewish communities interpret differently (non-Trinitarian)
- Cults may use this verse to promote false teaching (Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons)

**Translation Guidance**:

**Christian Orthodox Position**:
- **Preferred**: Trial number (if language has it) - grammatically encodes Trinity
- **Rationale**: NT revelation clarifies OT as Trinitarian (John 1:1-3, Matt 28:19, Col 1:16)
- **Alternative if no trial**: Plural with footnote explaining Trinity
- **Footnote example**: "The plural 'us' refers to the Trinity—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (cf. John 1:1-3, Matt 28:19)"

**Critical Warnings**:
- NEVER obscure Trinity reference - core Christian doctrine
- NEVER suggest angels participate in creation (contradicts Isaiah 44:24 "I alone")
- NEVER use interpretations denying Christ's deity (Arian heresy)

**Denominational Unity**: Protestant/Catholic/Orthodox/Coptic unified on Trinity substance, minor variations in technical terminology

**Non-Orthodox Views** (for translator awareness):
- **Jehovah's Witnesses** (cult): Jehovah + Michael the Archangel - REJECTED (denies deity of Christ, John 1:1)
- **Mormons/LDS** (cult): Council of gods - REJECTED (polytheism, violates Deut 6:4, Isa 44:6-8)
- **Jewish** (non-Messianic): Majestic plural or divine council - VALID within Judaism, NOT Christian orthodox
- **Islamic**: Majestic plural - VALID within Islam, NOT Christian orthodox

**Other Verses**:
- **Genesis 1:27**: "So God created mankind in his own image" - switch from plural "us" to singular "he"
- **Genesis 11:7**: "Come, let us go down" - similar plural construction

### 2. Apostolic vs Universal Church (Acts 15:25, Acts 15:28)

**Verse Pattern**: Acts 15:25 "It seemed good to us to choose men and send them to you"

**Affected Values**: First Exclusive (apostles only) vs First Inclusive (including congregation)

**Theological Stakes**: **MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Affected Doctrines**:
- Apostolic authority
- Church governance
- Distinction between leadership and congregation

**Denominational Implications**: Yes - affects understanding of church structure

**Cultural Sensitivity**: N/A (not culturally specific)

**Translation Guidance**:

**Christian Orthodox Position**:
- **Context**: Jerusalem Council - apostles and elders making decision, sending letter to Gentile believers
- **Number Choice**: Affects who "we/us" refers to
  - If language distinguishes dual (exactly 2) vs plural (3+): Use plural (multiple apostles/elders present)
  - If language distinguishes paucal (few) vs plural (many): Use plural (formal council, not small group)
- **Person Choice** (related feature): Use First Exclusive - apostles speaking, congregation listening

**Note**: While this primarily affects the **Person System** feature (clusivity), the number choice interacts:
- Singular: Inappropriate (multiple leaders decided)
- Dual: Inappropriate (more than 2 leaders involved)
- Trial: Inappropriate (more than 3 leaders - Acts 15:6 "apostles and elders")
- Plural: Correct (multiple leaders, formal council)

---

### 3. Paired Disciples/Witnesses (Luke 24:13, Acts 13:2, Mark 6:7)

**Verse Pattern**: Luke 24:13 "Two of them were going to a village"

**Affected Values**: Dual (exactly 2) vs Plural (2+)

**Theological Stakes**: **LOW-MEDIUM** (accuracy, not doctrine)

**Affected Doctrines**:
- Witness principle (Deut 19:15, Matt 18:16 - "two or three witnesses")
- Apostolic sending practice (pairs for support and accountability)

**Denominational Implications**: No

**Cultural Sensitivity**: N/A

**Translation Guidance**:

**Preferred**: Dual (if language has it) - text explicitly states "two"

**Rationale**: Precision in translation, reflects explicit count in Greek (δύο, duo)

**Alternative**: Plural (if no dual) - accurate but less precise

**Theological Impact**: Minimal - number is stated explicitly in text, so no ambiguity

**Other Verses**:
- **Acts 13:2**: "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul" - dual (2 missionaries)
- **Mark 6:7**: "He sent them out two by two" - dual emphasis (paired sending)
- **Luke 10:1**: "The Lord appointed 72 others and sent them on ahead of him two by two" - dual emphasis

---

### 4. Small Group vs Large Assembly Worship (Matt 18:20, Matt 26:26, Acts 2:46)

**Verse Pattern**: Matthew 18:20 "Where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them"

**Affected Values**: Paucal (few, 2-5) vs Plural (many)

**Theological Stakes**: **MEDIUM** (affects worship practice understanding)

**Affected Doctrines**:
- Corporate worship theology
- Church assembly vs small group gathering
- Christ's presence with believers

**Denominational Implications**: Yes - affects understanding of "church" (formal assembly vs informal gathering)

**Cultural Sensitivity**: Honor/collectivist cultures may emphasize large gatherings; individualist cultures may emphasize small groups

**Translation Guidance**:

**Preferred**: Paucal (if language has it) - emphasizes small, intimate gathering

**Rationale**: 
- Context: Jesus contrasts large assembly (Matt 18:17 "tell it to the church") with small prayer gathering
- Theological point: Christ's presence doesn't require large formal assembly
- Range: "Two or three" explicitly paucal (small number)

**Alternative**: Plural with context clarifying "few" - accurate if paucal unavailable

**Denominational Considerations**:
- **High church traditions** (Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican): May emphasize formal assembly
- **Low church / house church traditions** (Anabaptist, Baptist, Pentecostal): May emphasize small group gathering
- Both are valid Christian perspectives - not mutually exclusive

**Other Verses**:
- **Matthew 26:26**: "While they were eating, Jesus took bread" - paucal (12 disciples, small group)
- **Acts 2:46**: "They broke bread in their homes" - paucal (house churches, small groups)
- **Contrast with Acts 2:41**: "About 3,000 were added" - large plural, formal assembly

---

### 5. God's People as Corporate Solidarity (Israel, Church)

**Verse Pattern**: References to Israel or the Church that can be singular (collective) or plural (individuals)

**Affected Values**: Singular (collective noun) vs Plural (individuals)

**Theological Stakes**: **MEDIUM** (affects understanding of corporate vs individual identity)

**Affected Doctrines**:
- Corporate solidarity in Scripture
- Individual vs collective responsibility
- Unity of God's people

**Denominational Implications**: Moderate - affects emphasis on individual vs corporate salvation

**Cultural Sensitivity**: Individualist cultures (Western) vs collectivist cultures (many Bible translation contexts)

**Translation Guidance**:

**Context-Dependent**:
- **Singular (collective)**: When emphasizing unity, corporate identity, or nation as a whole
  - Example: "Israel sinned" (Josh 7:1) - collective responsibility
  - Example: "The church is the body of Christ" (1 Cor 12:27) - corporate unity

- **Plural (individuals)**: When emphasizing individual members, diversity, or personal responsibility
  - Example: "All the Israelites grumbled" (Num 14:2) - individuals acting
  - Example: "Each member belongs to all the others" (Rom 12:5) - individual within corporate

**Complexity**: Hebrew and Greek often use singular for collective nouns; some translation languages require explicit disambiguation

**Not Arbitrary Because**: The singular vs plural choice affects theological emphasis on corporate solidarity vs individualism

---

## Arbitrary Contexts

### Pattern 1: Crowd Sizes and Quantities (85% of number references)

**Examples**:
- **John 6:10**: "About 5,000 men" - large plural (exact count given, no theological ambiguity)
- **Acts 1:15**: "A group numbering about 120" - plural (number stated)
- **Matthew 14:21**: "About 5,000 men, besides women and children" - plural

**Rationale**: Theology unchanged by specific number; text explicitly provides count

**Percentage of Feature**: ~85% of all number system references

---

### Pattern 2: Natural Pairs in Hebrew Dual Form

**Examples**:
- **Genesis 24:22**: "Two gold bracelets" (Hebrew: שְׁנֵי צְמִידִים) - dual in Hebrew
- **Exodus 25:18**: "Two cherubim" - dual in Hebrew
- **Body parts**: "eyes" (עֵינַיִם), "hands" (יָדַיִם), "ears" (אָזְנַיִם)

**Rationale**: Hebrew dual form is lexicalized for natural pairs; follows language convention, not theological choice

**Percentage of Feature**: ~5% of references

---

### Pattern 3: Travel Narratives and Mundane Events

**Examples**:
- **Acts 20:15**: "The next day we arrived at Samos" - plural (travel party)
- **Luke 8:22**: "One day he got into a boat with his disciples" - plural (disciples)
- **Genesis 12:4**: "So Abram went, as the LORD had told him; and Lot went with him" - plural (Abram + Lot)

**Rationale**: Number choice doesn't affect meaning or doctrine; straightforward reference

**Percentage of Feature**: ~8% of references

---

### Pattern 4: Generic Plural References

**Examples**:
- **Matthew 5:3**: "Blessed are the poor in spirit" - plural (general class)
- **John 1:12**: "To all who did receive him" - plural (open group)
- **Romans 3:23**: "For all have sinned" - universal plural

**Rationale**: Generic plural; number choice is conventional, not theologically significant

**Percentage of Feature**: ~2% of references

---

## Summary Statistics

| Classification | Percentage | Verse Count (estimated) | Reason Groups |
|----------------|------------|-------------------------|---------------|
| **Arbitrary** | ~95% | ~9,500+ verses | 4 reason groups |
| **Non-Arbitrary** | ~5% | ~500 verses | 5 reason groups |

## Non-Arbitrary Reason Groups for Sampling

For Stage 4 test set generation, ensure at least 2 occurrences of each non-arbitrary reason group:

1. **Trinity references** (Gen 1:26, Gen 1:27, Gen 11:7) - 3+ verses
2. **Apostolic authority/council** (Acts 15:25, Acts 15:28) - 2+ verses
3. **Paired disciples/witnesses** (Luke 24:13, Acts 13:2, Mark 6:7) - 10+ verses
4. **Small group vs large assembly** (Matt 18:20, Matt 26:26, Acts 2:46) - 5+ verses
5. **Corporate solidarity** (Israel/church references) - 20+ verses

**Total non-arbitrary sample needed**: ~40+ verses across 5 reason groups

**Arbitrary sample needed**: ~260+ verses (for balanced 100+ per value: singular/dual/trial/paucal/plural)
