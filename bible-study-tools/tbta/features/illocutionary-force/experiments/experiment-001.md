# Illocutionary Force Testing - Experiment 001

## Objective

Test and validate methods for categorizing and predicting illocutionary force across a diverse sample of Bible verses and TBTA languages. Develop reproducible force-prediction methodology with accuracy metrics and language-family patterns.

---

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Theory Foundation
Establish linguistic and theological framework for force analysis:
1. Review speech act theory (Austin, Searle, Searle-Vanderveken)
2. Document TBTA force categories and their definitions
3. Identify major language-family patterns for force marking
4. Establish confidence levels for predictions by context type

### Phase 2: Test Corpus Development
Select representative Bible verses that test different force categories:
- Declaratives: Simple assertions, theological claims
- Yes-No Interrogatives: Direct yes/no questions, testing questions, rhetorical questions
- Wh-Interrogatives: Information-seeking questions
- Imperatives: Direct commands, instructions, prohibitions, gentle commands
- Hortatives: Group exhortations, proposals
- Exclamatives: Expressions of awe, wonder, triumph

### Phase 3: Blind Prediction
For each verse:
1. Identify force type in source (Greek/Hebrew) based on form
2. Predict force category
3. Determine how different language families would mark this force
4. Create prediction matrix across TBTA languages

### Phase 4: Validation
Compare predictions against TBTA annotated data (when available) and linguistic research on target languages.

### Phase 5: Error Analysis
Categorize prediction failures and extract patterns.

## Test Case 1: Matthew 3:2 - Straightforward Imperative

### Verse Context
**Matthew 3:2 (Greek)**
"Μετανοέω γάρ ἐγγίζει ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν."

"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."

**Detailed Analysis:**
- **First clause**: "Μετανοέω" (Metanoeō) = Imperative, second-person plural
- **Particle**: "γάρ" (gar) = "for" (explanation, not force marking)
- **Second clause**: Declarative statement of fact (reason for repentance)
- **Register**: John the Baptist to crowds; direct, urgent, no formality markers
- **Theological force**: Prophetic command with theological grounding

### Source Language Force Determination

**Form**: Imperative verb (μετανοέω in imperative mood)
**Force**: IMPERATIVE
**Subtype**: Direct command without politeness softening
**Theological Content**: Urgent prophetic call to action
**Register**: Informal/urgent; not respectful form, but appropriate to prophetic voice

### Predictions for TBTA Languages

#### Prediction Strategy: Direct Marking Languages

| Language Family | Language | Predicted Form | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|
| **East Asian** | Mandarin | "悔改吧!" (huǐgǎi ba!) | Direct imperative + particle for finality; prophet's authority doesn't require politeness |
| | Japanese | "悔い改めなさい!" (kuikai-atamare nasai!) | Polite imperative (-nasai) fitting biblical register; less harsh than plain form |
| | Korean | "회개하세요!" (hwigaehaseyo!) | Formal imperative appropriate to prophetic address |
| **Indo-European** | Spanish | "¡Arrepentíos!" | Archaic plural form fits prophetic tone; exclamation mark conveys urgency |
| | German | "Buße tut!" | Direct form; theological register through archaic language choice |
| **Austronesian** | Tagalog | "Magisip ng muli!" (Mag-isip ng muli!) | Imperative prefix; straightforward prophetic command |
| | Indonesian | "Bertobatlah!" | Imperative with suffix; direct prophetic register |

#### Prediction Strategy: Particle-Based Languages

**Mandarin Deeper Analysis:**
- 悔改 (huǐgǎi) = repent (verb)
- 吧 (ba) = imperative particle (converts statement to command)
- Combined: Direct, urgent command
- Register: Fitting prophetic voice; no excessive politeness markers

**Japanese Deeper Analysis:**
- 悔い改める (kuikai-atamare) = repent (verb root)
- Special form: polite imperative (-nasai) chosen because:
  - Direct form (-e, -ro) would be too harsh in biblical translation
  - Polite form (-nasai) conveys command without rudeness
  - Honorific form not appropriate (prophet, not subordinate)

### Validation Questions

1. **TBTA Data Check**: How are imperatives marked in Greek-to-X translations for these languages?
2. **Language Family Patterns**: Do East Asian languages consistently use particles for imperatives? Do Austronesian languages use dedicated prefixes?
3. **Register Choices**: Which languages choose formal vs. informal imperative forms for prophetic speech?

### Success Criteria
- Predictions match TBTA marked data for 70%+ languages
- Language family patterns are consistent within families
- Register choices are theologically appropriate

## Test Case 2: John 3:16 - Mixed Declarative and Implicit Theology

### Verse Context
**John 3:16 (Greek)**
"Οὕτως γὰρ ἠγάπησεν ὁ θεὸς τὸν κόσμον, ὥστε τὸν υἱὸν τὸν μονογενῆ ἔδωκεν, ἵνα πᾶς ὁ πιστεύων εἰς αὐτὸν μὴ ἀπόληται ἀλλὰ ἔχῃ ζωὴν αἰώνιον."

"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."

**Detailed Analysis:**
- **Main clause**: "ἠγάπησεν...ἔδωκεν" = Declarative (past-tense statements)
- **Subordinate clauses**: Explain purpose and condition (infinitive + imperative moods used)
- **Particle**: "γάρ" (gar) = "for" (explanation/reasoning, not force marking)
- **Theological significance**: Statement of fact, but carrying normative implications about God's love and salvation mechanism

### Source Language Force Determination

**Primary Force**: DECLARATIVE
- Statement of theological fact
- No imperative form; purely asserting what God did and will do
- No interrogative; not seeking information

**Secondary Pragmatic Force**:
- Functions as implicit exhortation (believe and have life)
- Carries emotional weight (expressing God's love)
- Inviting assent/belief through declaration

**Theological Content**: Core salvation doctrine
**Register**: Universal proclamation; no specific speaker-hearer relationship

### Predictions for TBTA Languages

#### Prediction Strategy: Declaratives Across Languages

| Language | Predicted Form | Force Marking | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|
| **English** | "For God so loved..." | No particles; relies on context | Declarative word order; theological register through formal language |
| **Mandarin** | "因为神爱世界..." (yīnwèi shén ài shìjiè) | Optional particle (le implied for completed action) | Completed action (past love); particle optional but helpful for clarity |
| **Japanese** | "神は世界をこのように愛したので..." (Kami wa sekai wo kono yō ni ai shita node) | Node (ので) = reason connector; no interrogative particle | Simple past statement; reason connector makes theological logic clear |
| **Spanish** | "Porque Dios amó al mundo..." | No particles; word order and formal register indicate declarative | Simple subject-verb-object order; formal register appropriate to theological statement |
| **German** | "Denn Gott hat die Welt so geliebt..." | No force marking; past perfect aspect communicates finality | German past perfect conveys completed, foundational action |
| **Tagalog** | "Dahil mahal ng Dino ang mundo..." | Word order indicates declarative; no particles needed | Straightforward declarative structure; theological register through word choice |
| **Swahili** | "Kwa sababu Mungu akaupendeeza dunia..." | Completed action aspect; ku- prefix with -a (past tense) | Swahili marks aspect through prefix; past tense of definitive theological statement |

#### Prediction Strategy: Subordinate Clause Analysis

**Purpose Clauses** ("in order that believers... have eternal life")
- **Form**: Subjunctive in Greek (ἔχῃ = subjunctive form of ἔχω)
- **Force**: Purpose statement with inherent exhortativeness
- **Target Language Marking**:
  - Languages with subjunctive: Use subjunctive form (Spanish "tenga")
  - Particles-based: May use purpose particles (Japanese ために tame ni)
  - Infinitive languages: Use infinitive or special forms

### Validation Questions

1. **Subordinate Clause Handling**: How do particle-based languages mark subordinate clauses without inflection?
2. **Aspect Marking**: Do Swahili, Bantu, and other aspect languages mark the eternal/permanent nature of God's love through aspect choice?
3. **Implicit Theology**: How is the implicit "you should believe" conveyed across languages?

### Success Criteria
- Main clause correctly identified as declarative across 90%+ languages
- Subordinate clause force categorization consistent
- Aspect/mood choices reflect theological content appropriately

## Test Case 3: Luke 12:49 - Challenging Interrogative-Form Declarative

### Verse Context
**Luke 12:49 (Greek)**
"Πῦρ ἦλθον βαλεῖν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ τί θέλω εἰ ἤδη ἀνήφθη;"

"I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!"

**Detailed Analysis:**
- **First clause**: "Πῦρ ἦλθον βαλεῖν" = Declarative (infinitive expressing purpose)
- **Second clause**: "καὶ τί θέλω εἰ ἤδη ἀνήφθη?" = Interrogative FORM but EXCLAMATIVE/DECLARATIVE FORCE
  - Literally: "And what do I want if it were already kindled?"
  - Actually: "And how I wish it were already kindled!" (expressing desire, not seeking information)

**Force Category Challenge**: This verse uses interrogative form but functions as:
- Exclamative (expressing emotional intensity)
- Declarative (expressing fact about Jesus's desire)
- Implicit exhortation (about eschatological expectation)

### Source Language Force Determination

**Form**: Interrogative (question word + conditional structure)
**Actual Force**: EXCLAMATIVE + DECLARATIVE
**Theological Content**: Expression of Jesus's passion about coming judgment
**Emotional Force**: Strong, urgent, prophetic intensity
**Register**: Intimate (to disciples); passionate; prophetic

### Predictions for TBTA Languages

#### Challenge: Question Form, Non-Question Force

| Language | Strategy | Predicted Form | How Force Reconverts |
|---|---|---|---|
| **English** | Often converts to exclamative | "And how I wish it were already kindled!" | Converts interrogative to declarative exclamation |
| **Spanish** | Maintains interrogative with emotional context | "¿Y qué quiero sino que ya esté encendida?" | Question form + context makes exclamative force clear |
| **Japanese** | Uses question particle with context | "そして、もし既に火がつけば、どれほど...したいのか!" | か (ka) marks interrogative form, but ！ and context show exclamative |
| **Mandarin** | May use question form or convert to exclamative | "我多么希望这火已经点着了!" | Multi (多么) = exclamative marker showing emotional intensity |
| **Tagalog** | Maintains interrogative but adds emotional particles | "At ano ang nais ko kung naririnig na...?" | Word order and particles show emotional rather than information-seeking force |

#### Core Question for TBTA

**Does the source language form (interrogative) supersede the function (exclamative)?**

In strict grammatical analysis: Interrogative form
In pragmatic/theological analysis: Exclamative force
In translation practice: Varies by language
- English tends to convert to exclamative form
- Spanish tends to keep question form but add emotional context
- Japanese can do either depending on register choice

### Validation Questions

1. **Rhetorical Question Frequency**: How many biblical "questions" are actually rhetorical/exclamative?
2. **Language Tendencies**: Do some languages naturally convert exclamative-force interrogatives while others maintain form?
3. **Theological Clarity**: Does converting to exclamative form improve or lose theological nuance?

### Success Criteria
- Correctly identify as interrogative FORM but exclamative/declarative FORCE
- Predict language-specific conversion strategies
- Document why conversion occurs or is resisted

## Test Case 4: Matthew 19:6 - Hortative vs. Imperative Distinction

### Verse Context
**Matthew 19:6 (Greek)**
"Ὃ οὖν ὁ θεὸς συνέζευξεν, ἄνθρωπος μὴ χωριζέτω."

"Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate."

**Detailed Analysis:**
- **First clause**: "συνέζευξεν" = Declarative, past tense (statement of what God did)
- **Second clause**: "μὴ χωριζέτω" = Imperative FORM with HORTATIVE/EXHORTATIVE function
  - Form: Third-person imperative (unusual in English perspective)
  - Function: Universal principle/exhortation (not command to specific person)
  - Theological content: Norm for all humanity, not command to hearer

**Force Category Challenge**:
- This is technically an imperative form but functions as a universal principle (hovering between imperative and hortative)
- No first-person plural, but similar inclusive/universal force to hortative

### Source Language Force Determination

**Form**: Imperative (third-person singular μὴ χωριζέτω)
**Function**: Universal exhortation/principle (closest TBTA category: Hortative)
**Theological Content**: Normative principle about marriage indissolubility
**Scope**: Addresses all people, not specific hearer

### Predictions for TBTA Languages

#### Prediction Strategy: Handling Universal Imperatives

| Language | Strategy | Predicted Form | Linguistic Resource |
|---|---|---|---|
| **English** | Declarative conversion | "Let no one separate" or "No one should separate" | Converts to declarative norm or uses modal 'should' |
| **Spanish** | Maintains imperative but impersonal | "Que nadie lo separe" (subjunctive) | Subjunctive for universal/impersonal mandate |
| **German** | Passive or modal constructions | "Man soll sie nicht trennen" (one shall not...) | Passive or impersonal construction conveys universal norm |
| **Mandarin** | Modal verb or negative imperative | "谁都不应该分开他们" (no one should separate them) | Modal (应该 = should) conveys imperative force as universal norm |
| **Japanese** | Negative imperative + universal particle | "誰も分かれてはいけません" (dare mo wakarete wa ikemasen) | Negative imperative marks prohibition; particle marks universal scope |
| **Tagalog** | Negative imperative with universal scope | "Walang dapat na magbigay-daan sa pagpapahiwalay" | Negative imperative structured with universal subject |

#### Core Question for TBTA

**How do languages distinguish between:**
1. Specific command: "You (hearer), do X!"
2. Specific command: "Someone else (third party), do X!"
3. Universal exhortation: "No one should do X!" / "Everyone should do X!"

**Linguistic Resources:**
- English: Primarily context and modal verbs (should)
- Spanish: Subjunctive for impersonal/universal
- German: Passive, modal, or impersonal constructions
- Japanese: Universal particles or special marking
- Tagalog: Particular word order and article choices

### Validation Questions

1. **Third-Person Imperative Frequency**: How common are third-person imperatives in biblical text, and how do languages handle them?
2. **Universal vs. Specific**: Can systems reliably distinguish universal norms from specific commands?
3. **Register Impact**: Does treating universal exhortation as mere imperative change how readers perceive the norm?

### Success Criteria
- Identify form (imperative) vs. function (universal exhortation) distinction
- Predict language-specific resources for marking universal scope
- Document theological implications of different marking choices

## Test Case 5: Matthew 22:37-40 - Yes-No Interrogative with Embedded Rhetoric

### Verse Context
**Matthew 22:37-40 (Greek)**
Ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτῷ, Ἀγαπήσεις κύριον τὸν θεόν σου... ἐντολή πρώτη καὶ μεγάλη. δευτέρα ὁμοία αὐτῇ, Ἀγαπήσεις τὸν πλησίον σου ὡς σεαυτόν. ἐν ταύταις ταῖς δυσὶν ἐντολαῖς ὅλος ὁ νόμος καὶ οἱ προφῆται.

"Jesus replied: 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart... This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself. All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.'"

**Detailed Analysis:**
- **First clause**: Implied imperative (quoted as imperative from Deuteronomy 6:5)
- **Second clause**: Again imperative (Leviticus 19:18)
- **Framing**: Declarative statements about commandment status and law

**Force Complexity**:
- Quotes of commandments (imperative origin)
- But presented in teaching context (declarative content)
- Implies obedience requirement (imperative force)
- But structured as theological declaration about law's nature

### Source Language Force Determination

**Structure**: Mixed—declarative frame with imperative content

**Breakdown:**
1. Imperative quotes from Torah: "Love God" and "Love neighbor"
2. Declarative assessment: "This is the first commandment"
3. Declarative synthesis: "All the law hangs on these"
4. Implicit imperative: (You should follow these commandments)

### Predictions for TBTA Languages

#### Challenge: How are quoted imperatives handled in indirect reporting contexts?

| Language | Strategy | Sample Form | Marking |
|---|---|---|---|
| **English** | Maintains imperative in quotes | 'Love the Lord... Love your neighbor' then 'This is the first and greatest commandment' | Quotation marks show direct command; then declarative framing |
| **Spanish** | Similar structure with quotation handling | 'Amarás al Señor...' luego 'Este es el primer mandamiento' | Quotes preserve imperative; declarative frame follows |
| **Mandarin** | May use reportative particles | (Quotes) 然后 (ránhòu = then) 这是第一条 | Reportative structure with particles; imperative content preserved in quotes |
| **Japanese** | Uses reported speech particles | (Quotes with -to iu = "said that") その後 最初の戒め | Reported speech markers with imperative content in quotes |
| **Tagalog** | Similar quotation strategy | (Quoted imperatives) 'Ito ang unang utos' | Direct quotes preserve imperative; transitions to declarative frame |

#### Core Question for TBTA

**When imperatives appear in declarative contexts (quotation, reporting, teaching), how does target language mark the combination?**

Possibilities:
1. Preserve imperative form in quotes (most languages)
2. Convert quotes to declarative/infinitive forms (some languages)
3. Use special reportative particles (reported speech languages)
4. Mark shift from quoted force to framing force

### Validation Questions

1. **Quotation Handling**: How do languages mark shifts between quoted imperative and reporting declarative?
2. **Imperative Preservation**: Do all languages preserve imperative form in direct quotes?
3. **Theological Content**: Does preserving vs. converting imperatives affect reader understanding of command authority?

### Success Criteria
- Correctly identify multiple force types within single teaching unit
- Predict language-specific quotation-marking strategies
- Document theological implications of different quotation approaches

### Data Collection Strategy

For each test case, if TBTA annotations exist:

1. **Check TBTA GitHub**: https://github.com/AllTheWord/tbta_db_export
2. **Search for verse annotations**: Look for mood/force marking in TBTA data
3. **Identify language samples**: Which languages have these verses annotated?
4. **Compile results matrix**: Compare predictions vs. actual TBTA choices

### Validation Matrix Template

```
