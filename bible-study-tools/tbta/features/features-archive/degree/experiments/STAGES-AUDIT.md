## Overall Assessment

**Completion**: 4/6 completed, 2/6 partial
**Status**: mostly-complete
**Complies with STAGES.md**: mostly

## Recommendations

1. Add README.md with stage checklist
2. Document 10-phase methodology difference
3. Add formal peer review documentation
4. Preserve existing structure (GOOD RESULTS)

## Conclusion

**Degree is a GOOD implementation** with comprehensive testing (100 verses in adversarial set). Used 10-phase methodology effectively.

**Status**: ✅ **VALIDATED** - Acceptable with documentation updates needed
