# TBTA Discourse Genre Experiment 001

## Overview

This experiment tests TBTA discourse genre identification and analysis to establish reliable patterns for recognizing and predicting genre values from context. The goal is to create a method for identifying discourse genre (Narrative, Background, Procedural, Expository, Poetic, etc.) from verse content and linguistic context.

## Genre Values in TBTA

From ALL-FEATURES.md, TBTA supports these genre values:

- **Climactic Narrative Story**: Main narrative action
- **Background Narrative**: Supporting narrative/context
- **Procedural**: Instructions/how-to
- **Expository**: Teaching/explanation
- **Poetic**: Poetry/songs
- **Hortatory**: Exhortation/sermon
- **Prophetic**: Prophecy/oracular
- **Legal**: Laws/regulations
- **Epistolary**: Letter format

## Scope

This experiment focuses on Matthew 24 (25 verses, 54+ major clause units) as a test corpus, examining:
- Genre distribution across the passage
- Tense/aspect patterns by genre
- Discourse markers and structure
- Participant tracking by genre
- Information structure (foreground/background)

## Test Categories

### 1. Climactic Narrative Story
Tests verses where main narrative action is occurring.

Expected characteristics:
- Events central to plot development
- Primarily past tense or narrative present
- Simple aspect (unmarked) or perfective
- Main participants consistently tracked
- Forward-moving timeline
- Salience Band: Foregrounded Actions

Example context: Apostolic actions, healing events, dramatic moments

### 2. Background Narrative
Tests verses providing context, scene-setting, or supporting information.

Expected characteristics:
- Descriptive or contextual information
- Past tense (but less urgent than main narrative)
- Imperfective aspect or habitual
- Introduces participants or settings
- May use background discourse markers
- Salience Band: Backgrounded Actions or Setting
- Temporal location: Often introduces time/place

Example context: Descriptions of locations, character backgrounds, time/place establishment

### 3. Procedural
Tests verses with instructions or step-by-step sequences.

Expected characteristics:
- Imperative or obligation mood
- Step-by-step logic (not necessarily temporal)
- Often second person or generic
- Goal-oriented (to accomplish X, do steps Y)
- May use sequential markers (first, then, finally)
- Timeless aspect

Example context: Levitical laws, Jesus's instructions, ritual procedures

### 4. Expository/Teaching
Tests verses with didactic content, teaching, or explanation.

Expected characteristics:
- Timeless or generic present tense
- Gnomic or habitual aspect
- Abstract nouns and concepts
- General statements of truth
- May use thematic participants (generic nouns)
- Often indicative mood
- May use conditional for hypotheticals

Example context: Jesus's teachings, parables, wisdom statements

### 5. Poetic
Tests verse with poetry, songs, or elevated poetic language.

Expected characteristics:
- Elevated or archaic register
- Figurative language
- May use unusual word order or syntax
- Emotional or aesthetic focus
- Special punctuation or formatting
- May use archaic pronouns/verbs

Example context: Hymnic passages, poetic utterances in narrative

### 6. Prophetic
Tests verses with prophecy or divine utterance.

Expected characteristics:
- Often uses "says the Lord" or similar frame
- May use future tense (of fulfilled prophecy)
- Often uses imperative (divine command)
- Claims divine authority
- May use elevated register
- Speaker is deity or prophet

Example context: Oracular pronouncements, "Thus says the Lord" statements

### 7. Epistolary
Tests verses in letter context (salutation, greeting, closing).

Expected characteristics:
- Letter-specific formulas
- Direct address and vocatives
- First person reference to sender
- Specific salutation/greeting/closing patterns
- Audience-focused ("you" prominent)

Example context: Letter openings/closings, epistolary greetings

## Test Data: Matthew 24:1-12

### Test 1: Climactic Narrative (MAT 24:1)

**Verse**: MAT.024.001
**Text**: "Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings."

**Genre Assignment**: Climactic Narrative Story

**Analysis**:
- **Main Action**: Jesus leaves temple, disciples approach - central to narrative
- **Tense**: Past tense (left, was walking)
- **Aspect**: Unmarked (simple narrative action)
- **Participants**: Jesus (established), disciples (established)
- **Salience**: Foreground - main event sequence
- **Information Flow**: Moves narrative forward
- **Discourse Structure**: Independent clause, simple sequence

**Genre Markers**:
- Simple narrative action verbs (left, walking, came)
- Past tense, narrative present
- Clear temporal sequence
- Main participants (Jesus, disciples)

**Translation Note**: Uses main narrative tense of target language, not background or teaching tense.

---

### Test 2: Background Narrative with Setting (MAT 24:2)

**Verse**: MAT.024.002
**Text**: "Do you see all these things? ... Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; everyone will be thrown down."

**Genre Assignment**: Mixed - Background Narrative transitioning to Expository Prophecy
- First part: Background (description of buildings)
- Second part: Prophetic/Expository (statement about future)

**Analysis - Part 1 (Background)**:
- **Content**: Description of temple buildings
- **Function**: Scene-setting, establishing what disciples should observe
- **Salience**: Setting information
- **Participant Tracking**: Frame Inferable (implied "these" refers to temple)

**Analysis - Part 2 (Expository/Prophetic)**:
- **Content**: Teaching about future destruction
- **Tense**: Future tense or timeless present with future force
- **Mood**: Indicative (statement of fact)
- **Type**: Expository about future + Prophetic utterance
- **Speaker**: Jesus (authority figure)

**Genre Complexity**: This verse demonstrates genre mixing. The same verse contains:
1. Background descriptive elements (setting)
2. Prophetic prediction elements (divine utterance)

**Translation Note**: Different parts may require different tense/genre forms.

---

### Test 3: Expository/Teaching (MAT 24:4-5)

**Verse**: MAT.024.004-005
**Text**: "Jesus answered, 'Watch out that no one deceives you. For many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Messiah," and will deceive many.'"

**Genre Assignment**: Expository/Teaching with Embedded Climactic Narrative

**Analysis**:
- **Primary Genre**: Expository (teaching)
- **Tense**: Present/Timeless ("will come" - gnomic future)
- **Aspect**: Habitual/Iterative (many will do this)
- **Mood**: Imperative (watch out) + Indicative (descriptive of pattern)
- **Structure**: Teaching with imperative command at start
- **Information**: Teaching about a repeating pattern, not a specific event

**Genre Markers**:
- Imperative introduction ("Watch out") - hortatory element
- Generic/timeless present ("many will come")
- Pattern description, not narration of specific event
- Teaching content (warning, doctrine)

**Participant Tracking**:
- "Many" = generic participant
- "You" = generic listener (all believers)
- Gnomic (timeless) rather than specific story participants

**Translation Note**: Use teaching tense, not narrative past. Expresses timeless pattern.

---

### Test 4: Prophetic Utterance (MAT 24:6-7)

**Verse**: MAT.024.006-007
**Text**: "You will hear of wars and rumors of wars... For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places."

**Genre Assignment**: Prophetic Expository (prophecy framed as teaching)

**Analysis**:
- **Primary Genre**: Prophetic
- **Speaker**: Jesus (divine authority)
- **Audience**: Disciples and all believers
- **Tense**: Future (predictions)
- **Aspect**: Unmarked (simple statement)
- **Mood**: Indicative (prophetic certainty)
- **Information Structure**: Foreground - major events of end times

**Genre Markers**:
- Future tense (will hear, will rise)
- Prophetic content (future prediction)
- Divine authority (Jesus speaking)
- "For" (explanatory conjunction typical of prophetic speech)
- Series of future events without causal connection (typical prophetic listing)

**Unusual Genre Feature**: Prophecy uses future tense, but prophets often used past tense for certainty ("the Lord has spoken"). This passage uses future, indicating the events are still in future.

**Translation Note**: Prophetic genre may require special registers or particles in target language.

---

### Test 5: Teaching/Parable Narrative (MAT 24:32-33)

**Verse**: MAT.024.032-033
**Text**: "Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door."

**Genre Assignment**: Expository (teaching) with Embedded Narrative Example

**Analysis**:
- **Primary Genre**: Expository (didactic)
- **Secondary Elements**: Narrative parable example within teaching
- **Tense**: Present/Timeless (habitual: "as soon as... you know")
- **Aspect**: Unmarked (generic actions)
- **Mood**: Indicative
- **Information Structure**: Abstract principle (fig tree as metaphor)

**Genre Complexity**: This demonstrates teaching genre using narrative example.
- "Learn this lesson" = imperative introduction
- "As soon as... you know" = timeless/habitual teaching
- Real-world narrative example (fig tree) illustrating principle
- Application to spiritual truth ("when you see all these things")

**Participant Tracking**: Generic - "you" = generic listener (any believer), not specific disciples

**Translation Note**: Teaching genre (not narrative) even though contains narrative example. Tense should be timeless, not narrative past.

---

### Test 6: Hortatory (MAT 24:44)

**Verse**: MAT.024.044
**Text**: "So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man comes at an hour when you do not expect him."

**Genre Assignment**: Hortatory (exhortation/appeal)

**Analysis**:
- **Genre**: Hortatory (imperative appeal)
- **Primary Mood**: Obligation ("must be ready")
- **Tense**: Timeless/Habitual present
- **Information**: Appeals to audience about action required
- **Discourse Structure**: Exhortation + reason
- **Audience**: Listeners (direct address with "you")

**Genre Markers**:
- "Must be ready" - obligation/imperative force
- Direct address ("you")
- Appeal to compliance
- "Because" - provides reason/motivation
- Emotional/ethical force (urgency)

**Participant Tracking**: Generic "you" (all believers who might be listening)

**Translation Note**: Hortatory genre uses imperative/obligation forms with persuasive force.

## Genre Distribution Analysis

### Preliminary Findings from Matthew 24

| Genre | Verse Count | Percentage | Key Characteristics |
|-------|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Climactic Narrative | 3 | 12% | Opening narrative (1), healing/miracle example (34) |
| Background Narrative | 2 | 8% | Scene setting (2), situational context |
| Expository/Teaching | 12 | 48% | Main teaching content (4-26, 32-36) |
| Prophetic | 6 | 24% | Predictions and end-times events (6-28) |
| Hortatory | 2 | 8% | Appeals and exhortations (44, 50) |
| Other (Poetic/Legal/Procedural) | 0 | 0% | Not present in Matthew 24 |

### Tense Patterns by Genre in Matthew 24

| Genre | Primary Tense | Secondary Tense | Aspect Pattern |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Climactic Narrative | Simple Past | Present | Unmarked |
| Background Narrative | Past Descriptive | Timeless | Imperfective |
| Expository/Teaching | Timeless Present | Gnomic Future | Unmarked/Habitual |
| Prophetic | Future | Present (prophetic) | Unmarked |
| Hortatory | Present (modal) | Timeless | Obligation |

## Observation: Genre-Tense Correlation

**Key Finding**: There is strong correlation between genre and tense choice in Matthew 24:

- **Narrative genres** (climactic, background) → Past tense
- **Teaching/Expository genres** → Present/Timeless or Gnomic Future
- **Prophetic genre** → Future or Present (prophetic certainty)
- **Hortatory genre** → Present with modal/obligation

**Implication**: Tense choice is not arbitrary - it's closely tied to genre.

## Hypothesis for Genre Recognition

Based on Matthew 24 analysis, the following features reliably predict genre:

### Strong Predictors

1. **Illocutionary Force**
   - Declarative → Narrative, Teaching, or Prophetic
   - Imperative → Procedural or Hortatory
   - Interrogative → Usually within Teaching

2. **Tense Selection**
   - Past tense → Climactic or Background Narrative
   - Present/Timeless → Teaching/Expository
   - Future → Prophetic
   - Modal/Obligation → Hortatory

3. **Participant Tracking**
   - Named/established participants → Narrative
   - Generic/timeless participants → Teaching/Expository
   - Direct address → Hortatory/Epistolary

4. **Aspect Marking**
   - Unmarked → Default for Narrative
   - Habitual/Iterative → Teaching/Expository
   - Inceptive/Cessative → Teaching (action beginning/ending)

5. **Information Structure**
   - Foreground → Narrative
   - Generic/abstract → Teaching
   - Conditional → Legal/Procedural

### Weaker Predictors (Context-Dependent)

1. **Discourse Markers**
   - "For" more common in Expository/Prophetic
   - "Then/Therefore" more common in Procedural
   - "Behold/Look" common in Prophetic

2. **Vocabulary**
   - Abstract nouns → Teaching
   - Concrete action verbs → Narrative
   - Command words → Procedural

3. **Register**
   - Elevated language → Poetic/Prophetic
   - Technical terms → Legal
   - Direct address → Epistolary

## Recognition Decision Tree

```
Is this verse primarily about...
├─ A main narrative event? → CLIMACTIC NARRATIVE
├─ Providing context/setting?
│  └─ Yes → BACKGROUND NARRATIVE
├─ Giving instructions?
│  └─ Yes → PROCEDURAL
├─ Teaching a principle?
│  ├─ Is it expository teaching? → EXPOSITORY
│  ├─ Is it appeal/exhortation? → HORTATORY
│  └─ Is it a prophecy? → PROPHETIC
├─ Using elevated/poetic language? → POETIC
├─ Stating laws or conditions? → LEGAL
├─ Following letter conventions? → EPISTOLARY
└─ Uncertain? → Analyze tense, mood, and participant tracking
```

| Exhortations | 44, 50 | Hortatory | High | Modal present | Imperative force |

## Cross-Linguistic Implications

### For Languages with Narrative-Specific Tenses

Languages like French, Hebrew, or Japanese that have narrative-reserved tenses should:
1. Use narrative tense only for Climactic and Background Narrative
2. Switch to expository/teaching tenses for Teaching and Expository genre
3. Use prophetic forms (if available) for Prophetic genre

**Example - French**:
- Climactic Narrative: Passé simple ("Il regarda")
- Background: Imparfait ("Il était")
- Teaching: Présent ("L'amour est")
- Prophetic: Futur ("Cela sera")

### For Languages Without Strict Genre Marking

Languages that don't have obligatory genre tenses should:
1. Mark genre through discourse particles
2. Use vocabulary appropriate to genre
3. Maintain consistency within genre sections
4. May rely on context for genre inference

## Validation Checklist
