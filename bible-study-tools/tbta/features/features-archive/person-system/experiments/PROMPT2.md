# Person Systems: Algorithm v2.0 ⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL

**Feature**: Person Systems (Primary: Clusivity)
**Version**: 2.0 (EXPERIMENTAL)
**Status**: ⚠️ **Premature** - Based on n=1 divergence example, needs 5-10 more cases for validation
**Date**: 2025-11-09
**Based on**: v1.0 (commit f373646) + validation insights
**Validation Results**: 100% accuracy on real translations (7/7 verses) for v1.0 foundation

---

## ⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL STATUS WARNING

**This algorithm version is EXPERIMENTAL and premature:**

- **Dual perspective theory**: Based on only 1 divergence example (Genesis 1:26)
- **Evidence insufficient**: Need 5-10 divergence cases to establish pattern
- **Could be**: TBTA error, algorithm error, genuine ambiguity, OR systematic pattern (unproven)
- **Recommendation**: Use v1.0 for production, treat v2.0 as research hypothesis

**For production use**: Stick with Algorithm v1.0 (100% validated)

**v2.0 purpose**: Document hypothesis for future validation when more TBTA data available

## What's New in v2.0

### Major Enhancements
1. **Dual Perspective Mode** - Can operate in translation-guidance or discourse-analysis mode
2. **Perspective Awareness** - Explicitly identifies when perspectives may diverge
3. **Enhanced Confidence Calibration** - Refined based on validation results
4. **TBTA Integration Notes** - Documents relationship with TBTA annotations

### Changes from v1.0
- ✅ **All v1.0 rules retained** (100% validation accuracy)
- ➕ **Added**: Perspective selection framework
- ➕ **Added**: Divergence prediction for key contexts
- ➕ **Enhanced**: Documentation and usage notes

---

## Perspective Selection Framework (NEW)

### Mode 1: Translation Guidance (Default)
**Purpose**: Guide Bible translators in clusivity-marking languages
**Perspective**: Human reader is ultimate addressee
**Question**: "Should the translation use inclusive or exclusive form?"

**Use when**:
- Creating Bible translations
- Preparing translator notes
- Training translators
- Building translation memory

**Output**: Clusivity choice for actual translation use

### Mode 2: Discourse Analysis
**Purpose**: Analyze discourse structure within the biblical text
**Perspective**: Speaker-listener relationship in the text itself
**Question**: "Does the speaker include the text's listener in 'we'?"

**Use when**:
- Studying discourse patterns
- Analyzing rhetorical structures
- Academic biblical studies
- Comparing with TBTA annotations

**Output**: Discourse-internal clusivity relationship

---

## When Perspectives Diverge (NEW)

### Divergence Pattern: Divine Speech Contexts

**Context**: God/Jesus speaking, with divine "us/we"
**Examples**: Genesis 1:26, Genesis 3:22, Genesis 11:7

#### Translation Guidance Perspective (Mode 1)
- **Question**: Should human readers use inclusive or exclusive?
- **Answer**: EXCLUSIVE - humans are not divine, not included in Trinity
- **Reasoning**: Ultimate addressees (human readers) are not participants in divine council
- **Result**: Translators use EXCLUSIVE forms (kami, namin)

#### Discourse Analysis Perspective (Mode 2)
- **Question**: Does speaker (God) include listener (God) in "us"?
- **Answer**: INCLUSIVE - one Trinity person includes other Trinity persons
- **Reasoning**: Within-text speaker-listener are co-equal divine persons
- **Result**: TBTA marks as "First Inclusive"

**Both are correct** for their respective purposes!

### Other Potential Divergence Contexts

1. **Prophetic "we"** - Prophet speaking for God
   - Translation: May be exclusive (prophet + God vs. people)
   - Discourse: May analyze as God→people relationship

2. **Quoted speech** - Speech within speech
   - Translation: Analyze from reader's perspective
   - Discourse: Analyze each level separately

3. **Corporate solidarity** - Entity as one/many
   - Translation: Pragmatic decision based on target language
   - Discourse: Grammatical number of referent

---

## Algorithm v2.0: Dual-Mode Decision Framework

### Step 0: Select Perspective (NEW)
```
Choose operating mode:
- Mode 1: Translation Guidance (default)
- Mode 2: Discourse Analysis (for TBTA comparison)

If Mode 1 → Proceed with original algorithm
If Mode 2 → Add discourse-internal analysis layer
```

### Mode 1: Translation Guidance (Original Algorithm v1.0)

All rules from v1.0 apply unchanged (see ALGORITHM-v1.md).

**Summary**:
1. Level 1: Structural analysis (identify speaker, addressee, action, context)
2. Level 2: Primary rules (prayer, divine speech, contrast, reciprocal, invitation, witness)
3. Level 3: Secondary rules (shared experience, group distinction, authority)
4. Level 4: Genre defaults
5. Level 5: Discourse role analysis

**Validation**: 100% accuracy (7/7 verses)

### Mode 2: Discourse Analysis (NEW)

#### Additional Step: Internal Relationship Analysis
```
After identifying speaker and addressee in the TEXT:

1. Is the listener mentioned in the text?
   - If NO → Use translation perspective (Mode 1)
   - If YES → Analyze internal relationship

2. Does speaker's "we" include the text's listener?
   - Consider: Co-equal status, shared action capability, discourse role
   - Example: God→God (Trinity) = Inclusive within discourse
   - Example: Brothers→each other = Inclusive within discourse

3. Document both perspectives:
   - Internal: Speaker-listener relationship
   - External: Reader-oriented translation choice
```

## Enhanced Confidence Calibration (v2.0)

### High Confidence Contexts (95%+ expected accuracy)
1. **Prayer to God** - 100% validated (Matthew 6:9)
2. **Apostolic witness** - 100% validated (John 3:11, Acts 15:25)
3. **Worship invitation** - 100% validated (Psalm 95:1)
4. **Reciprocal action** - 100% validated (Hebrews 10:24)
5. **Explicit contrast "we...you"** - 100% validated (John 3:11, Exodus 3:18)
6. **Ethnic/group boundaries** - 100% validated (Exodus 3:18)

**Action**: Recommend high confidence predictions directly to translators

### Medium Confidence Contexts (75-90% expected accuracy)
1. **Complex discourse shifts** - Some validated (Isaiah 6:8 ✅)
2. **Pauline ambiguity** - Intentionally layered meaning
3. **Shared experience** - Usually inclusive, confirm with context
4. **Hierarchical authority** - Usually exclusive, check nuances

**Action**: Provide prediction with rationale, suggest translator verification

### Low Confidence Contexts (50-70% expected accuracy)
1. **Theological ambiguity** - Multiple valid interpretations
2. **Corporate solidarity** - Entity as one/many
3. **Quoted speech within speech** - Multi-level analysis
4. **Genre boundaries** - Mixed types in single passage

**Action**: Present as AMBIGUOUS with multiple options and reasoning

---

## Divergence Prediction Rules (NEW)

### Rule D.1: Divine Council Contexts
```
IF speaker = God/Jesus
AND discourse contains divine "us/we"
AND context = Creation/Judgment/Divine action
THEN:
  Translation Mode: EXCLUSIVE (humans not divine)
  Discourse Mode: INCLUSIVE (God includes God)
  Divergence: EXPECTED
  Note: "Both perspectives valid - different purposes"
```

### Rule D.2: Reciprocal "One Another"
```
IF action = reciprocal ("one another", "each other")
THEN:
  Translation Mode: INCLUSIVE (all must participate)
  Discourse Mode: INCLUSIVE (mutual action)
  Divergence: NONE
  Agreement: EXPECTED
```

### Rule D.3: Speaker Addressing External Listener
```
IF speaker = internal to text
AND listener = external to text (readers, future audience)
THEN:
  Translation Mode: Analyze reader relationship
  Discourse Mode: May differ based on text-internal analysis
  Divergence: POSSIBLE
  Check: Compare perspectives explicitly
```

---

## Usage Guidelines (v2.0)

### For Bible Translators (Mode 1)
```
1. Use Mode 1 (Translation Guidance) - default setting
2. Follow algorithm v1.0 decision framework
3. Apply high confidence predictions directly
4. Verify medium/low confidence predictions with:
   - Other translations in your language family
   - Parallel passages
   - Theological context
5. Document decisions for consistency
```

### For Biblical Scholars (Mode 2)
```
1. Select Mode 2 (Discourse Analysis) for TBTA comparison
2. Apply dual-layer analysis:
   - Internal: Speaker-listener in text
   - External: Reader-oriented guidance
3. Document both perspectives when they diverge
4. Note that divergence often reveals theological depth
5. Use for understanding discourse structure
```

### For TBTA Comparison
```
1. Expect Mode 2 to align better with TBTA
2. Genesis 1:26 pattern: Mode 2 "Inclusive", TBTA "First Inclusive" ✅
3. Genesis 42:21 pattern: Both modes "Inclusive" ✅
4. Document systematic patterns
5. Both approaches valid for respective purposes
```
