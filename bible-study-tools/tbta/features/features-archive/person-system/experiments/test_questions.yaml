      clusivity: "Context-dependent (kita/kami in some registers)"
      source: "Terjemahan Baru (TB)"
  rationale: |
    Selected Austronesian languages because they encode clusivity GRAMMATICALLY.
    Every first-person plural pronoun must choose inclusive or exclusive.
    This provides unambiguous evidence for what translators understood the passage to mean.

  next_steps: |
    1. Fetch translations for all 21 verses from Bible APIs or databases
    2. Analyze each translation's pronoun choice (inclusive vs exclusive)
    3. Calculate consensus percentage per verse
    4. Compare translation consensus with TBTA values (from test.yaml answer sheet)
    5. Document cases where translations provide clarity vs ambiguity
