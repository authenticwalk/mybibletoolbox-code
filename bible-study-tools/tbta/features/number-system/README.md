# Number System Feature

## Feature Definition

The **Number System** feature identifies grammatical number distinctions beyond the basic singular/plural dichotomy. While English and Biblical Greek/Hebrew primarily distinguish singular (1) from plural (2+), many languages grammatically encode finer number distinctions:

- **Dual** (2): Exactly two entities
- **Trial** (3): Exactly three entities
- **Quadrial** (4): Exactly four entities (highly contested)
- **Paucal** (few): Small inexact group (typically 3-15)

**Linguistic Status**: These number distinctions are grammatically obligatory in languages that mark them - speakers cannot avoid choosing the correct number form when using nouns, pronouns, and verbs.

**Translation Impact**: Languages with these distinctions require translators to determine precise counts or groupings even when the source text (Hebrew/Greek) uses ambiguous plural forms.

## Theological/Linguistic Context

### Biblical Example: Genesis 1:26 "Let Us Make"

**Hebrew Text**: `נַֽעֲשֶׂה אָדָם בְּצַלְמֵנוּ` (na'aseh adam b'tsalmenu - "Let us make man in our image")

**Grammatical Form**: Hebrew uses plural verb (`na'aseh` = "let us make") and plural suffix (`-enu` = "our")

**Number Ambiguity**: Hebrew plurals don't specify whether "us" = 2, 3, 4+, or many

**Translation Challenge for Trial Languages**:
- If translating into a language with **trial number** (exactly 3), the translator must choose:
  - **Trial**: "Let us-three make" → Implies Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit)
  - **Plural**: "Let us-many make" → Implies divine council or angels
  - **Dual**: "Let us-two make" → Problematic for Trinitarian theology

**Interpretation Note**: While some have suggested Genesis 1:26 could use trial number to indicate the Trinity, modern scholarship (including Trinitarian scholars like Michael Heiser) considers this reading the New Testament back into the Old Testament. The original Hebrew audience would have understood the plural in light of Ancient Near Eastern divine council imagery, not later Trinitarian theology. However, the **translation decision still matters** for languages that grammatically require trial vs. plural distinction.

**Other Interpretations**:
1. **Plural of Majesty**: Royal "we" (though grammatically, the verb is plural, not singular)
2. **Divine Council**: God speaking to His heavenly court
3. **Trinity**: Christian theological reading (not original meaning but valid theological application)
4. **Self-Deliberation**: God's internal dialogue

### Other Biblical Examples

**Dual Number Examples**:
- **Luke 24:13**: "Two of them" - requires dual in dual-marking languages
- **Acts 13:2**: "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul" - dual reference to two missionaries
- **Genesis 19:1**: "Two angels came to Sodom" - dual number obligatory in Hebrew (מַלְאָכִים, mal'akhim with dual context)
- **Mark 6:7**: Jesus sent disciples "two by two" - dual emphasis

**Paucal Number Examples**:
- **Matthew 18:20**: "Where two or three gather" - paucal (small group, not large assembly)
- **John 2:6**: "Six stone water jars" - exact count, but paucal languages may categorize as "few"
- **Genesis 18:2**: "Three men" visiting Abraham - trial or paucal depending on language

## Language Family Analysis

### Stage 2: Languages Requiring Number System Feature

Based on typological research and language family documentation:

#### 1. **Austronesian Family** (176 languages in dataset)

**Dual Number**: Present in ~87 Oceanic languages (50% of Austronesian dataset)
- **Samoan**: `lāua` (they-two), `tāua` (we-two-inclusive), `māua` (we-two-exclusive)
- **Fijian**: Dual pronouns for exactly two referents
- **Tok Pisin**: Trial pronouns (e.g., `mitripela` = we-three-exclusive)

**Trial Number**: Present in multiple Oceanic languages
- **Larike, Tolai, Raga, Wamesa**: Documented trial pronouns
- **Tok Pisin**: Only for pronouns, derived from Proto-Austronesian word for 'three'
- **Pattern**: May apply to numbers up to 5 in some languages

**Paucal Number**: Present in some Oceanic languages
- **Definition**: Small group greater than dual/trial but smaller than typical plural
- **Range**: Varies by language (up to ~5 items)
- **Note**: Historically derives from Proto-Austronesian 'three' but expanded semantically

**Grammatical Obligatoriness**:
- Almost all trials are **facultative** (optional), not obligatory
- Some languages have facultative dual + facultative trial (Larike)
- Some have obligatory dual + facultative trial (Ngan'gi)

**Translation Impact**: Medium-High
- Dual: Required for paired disciples, two witnesses, etc.
- Trial: Optional but theologically significant for Genesis 1:26
- Paucal: Helps distinguish small groups from large crowds

#### 2. **Indo-European Family** (135 languages in dataset)

**Dual Number**: Rare, preserved in only 4 Slavic languages
- **Slovenian**: Dual is obligatory for count 2, considered most distinctive feature of the language
  - Singular: `hiša` (house)
  - Dual: `hiši` (two houses)
  - Plural: `hiše` (three or more houses)
- **Upper Sorbian**: Complete dual system (Bible translated 1728)
- **Lower Sorbian**: Dual preserved
- **Kashubian**: Dual preserved

**Historical Note**: Biblical Hebrew and Ancient Greek both had dual forms
- **Biblical Hebrew**: Dual endings `יִם-` (-ayim) for paired body parts (eyes, ears, hands, feet) and time periods. *Never found in adjectives, verbs, or pronouns.*
- **Ancient Greek**: Had dual across nouns, verbs, adjectives (not in Koine Greek used in NT)
- **Pattern**: Hebrew used dual primarily for natural pairs; Slovenian uses dual *except* for natural pairs (opposite pattern!)

**Translation Impact**: Low-Medium (only 4 languages)
- Critical for Slovenian Bible (12th language with complete Bible, 1583)
- Natural alignment with Hebrew dual forms for body parts
- Important for translation accuracy but affects very few languages

#### 3. **Trans-New Guinea Family** (129 languages in dataset)

**Dual Number**: Very common across the family
- **Proto-TNG Reconstruction**: *-li, *-t (dual markers)
- **Pattern**: Three-way distinction common: Singular / Dual / Plural
- **Examples**:
  - **Wantoat**: Three-way (sg/dual/pl) in pronouns
  - **Yimas**: Four-way (sg/dual/paucal/pl) in pronouns
  - **Amele**: Plural marking (-el) restricted to kinship terms

**Paucal Number**: Present in some languages
- **Yimas**: Distinct paucal number (between dual and plural)
- **Range**: "A few" - typically 3-15 items

**Translation Impact**: High
- Dual very significant for Scripture pairs (two disciples, two witnesses, etc.)
- Hebrew dual forms may map directly to TNG dual
- "Both" and "all" require careful distinction
- Collective plurals affect rendering of group nouns

#### 4. **Australian Family** (36 languages in dataset)

**Paucal Number**: Common feature
- **Range**: 3-15 items (varies by language)
- **Warlpiri**: Paucal + dual number system
- **Pattern**: Often combines with dual for fine-grained number distinctions

**Dual Number**: Varies by kinship
- Some languages have dual only for certain noun classes
- Kinship terms often trigger dual number

**Translation Impact**: Medium
- Paucal helps distinguish small groups from large crowds
- Important for passages mentioning "a few" disciples or witnesses

#### 5. **Afro-Asiatic Family** (25 languages in dataset)

**Dual Number**: Classical Arabic and Hebrew only
- **Classical Hebrew**: Dual for paired body parts and time periods
- **Classical Arabic**: Full dual system (no longer in Modern Standard Arabic dialects)
- **Pattern**: Limited to nouns, not verbs or adjectives

**Translation Impact**: Low (historical languages only)
- Important for understanding source text morphology
- Modern varieties have lost dual

#### 6. **Other Families with Number Systems**

**Polynesian Languages** (subset of Austronesian):
- **Sursurunga** (New Ireland): Claimed to have quadrial (exactly 4)
- **Marshallese** (Marshall Islands): Claimed to have quadrial
- **Scholarly Debate**: Linguist Michael Cysouw argues true quadrals don't exist

**Note on Quadrial**: Highly contested. Only 2 languages (Sursurunga, Marshallese) claimed to have it. Most linguists consider these extended paucals rather than true quadrials.

## TBTA Encoding Details

### Proposed Encoding Strategy

**Feature Name**: `number_system`

**Values**:
- `singular` - One entity
- `dual` - Exactly two entities
- `trial` - Exactly three entities
- `paucal` - A few entities (small inexact group)
- `plural` - Multiple entities (more than paucal or unspecified)

**Scope**: Applied to noun phrases, pronouns, and verb agreement

**Example Annotation** (Genesis 1:26):
```yaml
reference: "GEN 1:26"
text: "Let us make mankind in our image"
number_system:
  value: "plural"  # Hebrew plural, ambiguous between trial/plural
  note: "Hebrew uses plural verb and pronoun. Languages with trial number must choose between trial (Trinity interpretation) or plural (divine council interpretation)."
  trial_interpretation: "possible"  # Flags verses where trial could be theologically significant
```

**Example Annotation** (Luke 24:13):
```yaml
reference: "LUK 24:13"
text: "two of them were going"
number_system:
  value: "dual"  # Explicitly two individuals
  note: "Dual-marking languages must use dual number for 'two disciples'"
```

## Research Notes

### Scholarly Consensus on Genesis 1:26

**Trinitarian Scholars on "Let Us Make"**:
- **Michael Heiser**: "Technical research in Hebrew grammar and exegesis has shown that the Trinity is not a coherent explanation. Seeing the Trinity in Gen 1:26 is reading the New Testament back into the Old Testament."
- **Gordon J. Wenham** (World Biblical Commentary): "Christians have traditionally seen [Gen. 1:26] as adumbrating the Trinity. It is now universally admitted that this was not what the plural meant to the original author."

**Main Interpretations**:
1. **Divine Council**: Most scholarly consensus - God addressing heavenly court
2. **Plural of Majesty**: Traditional rabbinic interpretation
3. **Trinity**: Christian theological reading (valid application, not original meaning)
4. **Self-Deliberation**: God's internal dialogue

**Translation Implication**: While trial number *could* be used theologically to express Trinitarian doctrine in translation, it should be noted that this is a theological application rather than the original Hebrew meaning.

### Linguistic Typology Sources

- **Greville Corbett (1994)**: Survey showing no known cases of obligatory trial
- **Michael Cysouw**: Argues true quadrals don't exist
- **Robert Blust**: Proto-Austronesian reconstruction includes number system evolution
- **Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database**: 500+ languages documented, includes number systems

### External Validation Opportunities

**Languages with Grammatical Number Distinctions**:
1. **Samoan**: Dual + trial in pronouns
2. **Slovenian**: Obligatory dual (test against Dalmatinova Biblija 1583)
3. **Tok Pisin**: Trial pronouns (test against Nupela Testamen)
4. **Warlpiri**: Paucal + dual (test against Lajamanu Bible Translation Project)

**Validation Strategy**: Compare TBTA annotations against real Bible translations in these languages to check if translators made same dual/trial/paucal decisions our algorithm predicts.
