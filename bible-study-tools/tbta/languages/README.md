# TBTA Language Resources

**Purpose**: Document how TBTA features apply to specific language families and provide guidance for Bible translators working in 1,000+ languages.

**Status**: Migration pending - comprehensive language resources exist in previous research phase and will be migrated here.

## Migration Plan

**Source Materials**:
- `/plan/tbta-rebuild-with-llm/languages/` - Detailed language family analyses
- `/plan/tbta-rebuild-with-llm/combined/language-adaptation-guide.md` - Cross-linguistic patterns

**Migration Approach**:
1. Review and validate existing language documentation
2. Restructure by language family (Austronesian, Niger-Congo, Sino-Tibetan, etc.)
3. Link features to specific language requirements
4. Create progressive disclosure structure (≤200 lines per README)

**Timeline**: After Tier A feature completion (Months 4-6)
