# Translation Guide for Trans-New Guinea Languages

This document outlines translation-relevant distinctions and practical recommendations for Bible translation work in Trans-New Guinea languages.

## High-Priority Features for Bible Translation

### 1. Clause Chaining and Switch-Reference

**Importance**: Pervasive in narrative discourse

**Characteristics**:
- Requires restructuring Greek/Hebrew coordinated clauses
- Essential for maintaining participant tracking
- Affects translation of narrative books (Gospels, OT histories)

**Translation strategy**:
- Identify all clause sequences in source text
- Determine subject continuity/change between clauses
- Mark medial verbs with appropriate switch-reference
- Reserve final verb for end of sequence with full TAM marking

**Example contexts**:
- Gospel narratives with sequential actions
- Old Testament historical narratives
- Pauline sentence structures with multiple clauses

### 2. Evidentiality (in evidential languages)

**Importance**: Critical for ~14 Highlands languages

**Characteristics**:
- Requires specifying information source for every statement
- May necessitate adding information not explicit in source text

**Translation strategy**:
- **Prophetic literature**: Mark divine revelation (reportive or special category)
- **Gospel narratives**: Distinguish eyewitness vs. reported events
- **Epistles**: Distinguish Paul's firsthand experience from transmitted teaching
- **Old Testament history**: Mark sources (eyewitness, traditional narrative, etc.)

**Evidential categories to consider**:
- Visual: Direct observation (much of Gospel narrative)
- Reportive: Hearsay (quotations, traditional accounts)
- Inferential: Logical deduction (some wisdom literature)
- Participatory: Direct involvement (apostolic testimony)

**Languages with evidentiality** (see sub-families.md):
- Ok-Oksapmin family languages
- Duna-Bogaya family languages
- Engan family languages
- Kutubuan languages
- Bosavi family languages

### 3. Dual Number

**Importance**: Important for pairs in Scripture

**Examples from Scripture**:
- Two disciples sent by Jesus
- Two witnesses (Revelation)
- Two angels (various contexts)
- "Both" in Hebrew dual forms

**Translation strategy**:
- Identify all dual referents in source text
- Use dual number throughout passage for consistency
- Hebrew dual forms find direct equivalents
- Watch for implicit duals (e.g., "the two" may be unmarked in Greek)

### 4. Multiple Past Tenses

**Importance**: Greek aorist/perfect/imperfect distinctions

**Characteristics**:
- Remote vs. recent past affects narrative sequencing
- May require temporal adverbs to disambiguate
- Some languages distinguish today's past, yesterday's past, remote past

**Translation strategy**:
- Map Greek tense/aspect to appropriate TNG past category
- Aorist → often remote past
- Perfect → may require recent past with continuing relevance
- Imperfect → habitual past or progressive aspect
- Use temporal adverbs when tense alone insufficient

### 5. Ergative Case Marking

**Importance**: Agent-patient relations in transitive clauses

**Characteristics**:
- Optional ergativity based on animacy/focus/disambiguation
- Affects subject prominence in translation

**Translation strategy**:
- Mark highly animate/agentive subjects with ergative
- Use ergative for focus/contrast
- Leave absolutive unmarked for less salient referents
- Apply consistently within pericopes

### 6. Serial Verb Constructions

**Importance**: Causatives, benefactives, aspectual marking

**Characteristics**:
- Greek compound verbs may map to serial constructions
- Complex events require verb sequencing

**Translation strategy**:
- Identify causative constructions in source text → use causative serialization
- Benefactive/dative constructions → use 'give' serial verb
- Aspectual nuances → use 'stay' (progressive), 'finish' (completive)
- Motion + action → directional serial verb + main verb

**Example mappings**:
- Greek *didōmi* "give" + indirect object → serial construction
- Greek compound verbs (*kata-bainō* "go down") → serial or directional affix

### 7. Spatial Deixis and Elevation

**Importance**: Geography-based narratives

**Characteristics**:
- "Go up," "come down" require elevation specification
- Ascension/descension language maps naturally

**Translation strategy**:
- Hebrew *'alah* (go up) → upward motion verb
- Hebrew *yarad* (go down) → downward motion verb
- "Go up to Jerusalem" → naturally marked for elevation
- "Come down from the mountain" → downward motion marked
- Ascension of Christ → upward motion highly salient
- Descent of Holy Spirit → downward motion marked

### 8. Possession Systems

**Importance**: Kinship, body parts, metaphorical possession

**Characteristics**:
- Alienable/inalienable distinction
- Extensive classifier systems require appropriate selection

**Translation strategy**:
- **Kinship terms**: Always inalienable ("his father," "my son")
- **Body parts**: Always inalienable ("his hand," "their hearts")
- **"Son of God"**: Requires proper kinship inalienable marking
- **Possessed objects**: Alienable ("his cloak," "their possessions")
- **Metaphorical possession**: Evaluate case-by-case
  - "My people" (relationship) → likely inalienable
  - "Your faith" (experiential) → likely inalienable
  - "Their money" (object) → alienable

## Medium-Priority Features

### 9. Topic Marking

**Importance**: Affects information structure in translation

**Translation strategy**:
- Identify fronted elements in Greek/Hebrew
- Mark with topic particle
- Use for focus and emphasis
- Maintain topic continuity across clause chains

### 10. Quotative Systems

**Importance**: Direct vs. indirect speech strategies

**Translation strategy**:
- Use appropriate quotative verb in medial form
- Mark perspective (mono- vs. bi-perspectival)
- Integrate with switch-reference system
- Old Testament dialogue requires explicit quotative frames
- Gospel teaching may use indirect speech for reported sayings

### 11. Negation Patterns

**Translation strategy**:
- Prohibitions (negative imperatives) may require distinct form from negative statements
- Scope of negation may differ from Greek
- Double negatives may not work as emphatic negation

### 12. Aspect Marking

**Translation strategy**:
- Progressive aspect → grammaticalized 'stay' serial verb
- Completive aspect → grammaticalized 'finish' serial verb
- Habitual aspect → habitual past tense or aspectual marking
- Greek present progressive → TNG progressive serial verb

## Challenges Unique to Trans-New Guinea Languages

## Recommendations for Commentary Development

### Priority Areas for Tool Development

1. **Clause Structure Tools**
   - Identify clause chains in source texts
   - Map Greek/Hebrew coordination to TNG medial/final verbs
   - Track participant reference for switch-reference marking

2. **Evidentiality Annotation**
   - For Highlands languages: Mark information source for each statement
   - Distinguish eyewitness, reported, inferential, divine revelation
   - Critical for prophetic and Gospel literature

3. **Person and Number Tracking**
   - Track dual number referents throughout passages
   - Identify transitive/intransitive verb patterns for case marking
   - Person agreement in verb morphology

4. **Spatial and Directional Marking**
   - Identify motion verbs with elevation implications
   - Mark "ascend"/"descend" language
   - Geographic movement tracking

5. **Possession Classification**
   - Mark alienable/inalienable possession contexts
   - Kinship terms requiring special treatment
   - Body part metaphors

### Language-Specific Considerations

For each TNG language translation project:

1. **Determine sub-family membership** to predict likely grammatical features
2. **Check for evidentiality** (especially Highlands languages)
3. **Document specific TAM system** (number of past tenses, aspect categories)
4. **Identify case marking pattern** (ergative optional or obligatory?)
5. **Catalog serial verb constructions** for causatives, benefactives, aspect
6. **Map spatial deixis system** (elevation-based or other)
7. **Determine number system** (dual presence? trial? paucal?)

### Cross-Linguistic Comparison

Trans-New Guinea languages would benefit from comparison with:

- **Other SOV languages** (Turkish, Japanese, Korean) for clause structure strategies
- **Ergative language translations** (Basque, Georgian, Mayan languages) for case marking
- **Evidential language translations** (Tibetan, Quechua, Cherokee) for information source marking
- **Dual-number translations** (Slovenian, Arabic, Sanskrit) for pair rendering

Study existing translations in these language types to develop best practices applicable to TNG contexts.

## Translation Workflow Summary

### Step 1: Language Analysis
- Identify sub-family and predicted features
- Document actual grammatical system through fieldwork
- Create comprehensive grammar sketch
- Identify translation-critical features

### Step 2: Genre-Specific Strategy Development
- **Narrative** (Gospels, OT history): Clause chaining, switch-reference, participant tracking
- **Prophetic**: Evidentiality, quotative systems
- **Epistolary**: Discourse structure, complex syntax management
- **Poetry**: Parallel structures, metaphor handling
- **Apocalyptic**: Participant tracking, visionary evidentials

### Step 3: Feature Mapping

  - Greek/Hebrew tenses → TNG TAM categories
  - Coordinate clauses → Medial/final verb patterns
  - Pronominal reference → Number and case marking
  - Spatial language → Directional systems
  - Possession → Alienable/inalienable categories

### Step 4: Translation Execution
- Maintain consistency within pericopes
- Track participants systematically
- Apply evidential strategy consistently
- Use natural TNG discourse patterns

### Step 5: Review and Revision
- Check switch-reference consistency
- Verify evidential marking accuracy
- Ensure natural clause chaining
- Validate verb morphology
- Test with native speakers for naturalness

## Conclusion

Trans-New Guinea languages present unique challenges for Bible translation, primarily due to:
1. Clause chaining systems requiring discourse restructuring
2. Evidentiality demanding explicit information source marking
3. Complex verbal morphology with switch-reference
4. Limited verb lexicons requiring serial constructions

However, these same features offer opportunities for natural, culturally appropriate translations that leverage the grammatical resources TNG languages provide. Success requires:
- Deep understanding of the specific language's grammar
- Awareness of general TNG typological patterns
- Systematic approach to feature mapping
- Collaboration with native speakers
- Willingness to restructure source text patterns for natural TNG expression

The extensive morphological marking in TNG languages allows for explicit tracking of participants, information sources, and event relationships that may be implicit in Greek/Hebrew, potentially resulting in translations that are clearer and more explicit than the source texts in these domains.
