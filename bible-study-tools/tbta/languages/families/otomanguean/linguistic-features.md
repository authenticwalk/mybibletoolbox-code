## Core Linguistic Features

### 1. Tone Systems

**Universal tonal nature**: All 69 Otomanguean languages in the database are tonal.

**Tonal variation**:
- **Minimum**: 2 level tones
- **Common range**: 2-4 tones per language
- **Maximum**: 5 level tones (Trique, Usila Chinantec)
- **Contour tones**: Both register and contour tone systems exist, with syllables having high, mid, or low pitches, or gliding from one pitch to another
- **Whistled speech**: Zapotec, Chinantec, and Mazatec varieties can be whistled—reproducing tone, stress, and sentence rhythm through pitch alone. Short conversations can be sustained in whistled form.

**Phonological consequence**: Tone carries lexical and grammatical information throughout the family.

**Historical significance**: Otomanguean is the oldest language family with evidence of tonal contrast in the proto-language (Proto-Otomanguean, ~4400 BCE).

### 2. Word Order: Verb-Subject-Object (VSO)

**Primary pattern**: V-S-O is the basic/predominant word order in Otomanguean languages [Languages Gulper: Otomanguean; "the verb occupies the initial position in the sentence, and the predominant order is Verb-Subject-Object"].

**Verb-initial property**: Otomanguean languages are head-initial.

**Variation**:
- Some Otomi dialects (Toluca, San Ildefonso Querétaro) show SVO as most frequent word order
- Most other Otomanguean languages maintain VSO as basic order
- Proto-Otomi and historically other Otomanguean languages had VSO

**Word order features**: Possessors and modifiers follow the nouns they possess/modify, while numerals precede the nouns they modify.

### 3. Morphology: Complex and Agglutinative

**Type**: Otomi verb morphology is either fusional or agglutinating depending on analysis, described as synthetic with elements of both.

**Complexity level**: "Incredibly complex inflectional class systems brought about by rich arrays of suffixes, prefixes, complex tonal patterns and stem alternations which may co-occur in a single word form".

**Morphological processes** (language-dependent):
- **Infixation**: Particularly prominent in Otomi verb inflection
- **Consonant mutation**: Stem modification for grammatical function; the initial consonant of the verb root changes according to morphophonemic patterns to mark present vs. non-present, and active vs. passive
- **Apocope**: Loss of final segments
- **Tonal marking**: Grammatical information conveyed through tone changes

**Noun morphology**:
- More analytic than verbal morphology
- Plurality often marked through noun phrase elements (quantifiers, numbers) rather than on noun itself

**Morphosyntactic typology**: Mixed synthetic and analytic structures:
- **Phrase level**: Synthetic (morphologically dense)
- **Sentence level**: Analytic (more grammatical particles, less inflection)
- **Verbal morphology**: Head-marking (agreement on verb)
- **Nominal morphology**: More analytic

**Verb morphology variation**:
- Fusional or agglutinating depending on analysis
- Infixation, mutation, apocope prominent in some languages
- Relies on verb affixes and particles for tense/aspect (not English-style conjugation)

### 4. Syllable Structure

**Predominant pattern**: Open syllables (CV) [Languages Gulper: Otomanguean; "syllables are generally open (mainly CV) except those ending in a glottal stop"]
- Syllables primarily end in vowels
- Or in /h/ or glottal stop (in some languages)

**Exception**: Oto-Pamean languages have unusual consonant clusters; syllable-initial clusters occur with restricted combinations, except in Oto-Pamean where combinations are larger.

**Segmental note**: Many Otomanguean languages lack labial consonants (no /p/, /b/), though this varies by language.

### 5. Nasal Vowels

Many Oto-Manguean languages have phonemic vowel nasalization. Some languages display nasal harmony (e.g., Mixtec), and complex nasal-stop segments appear in various languages [Glossa: Nasal allophony and nasalization in Xochistlahuaca Amuzgo].

### 6. Analytic Tendencies

While morphologically complex, Otomanguean languages are "all tonal languages and more analytic (less agglutinating) than other Meso-American languages, having comparatively few morphemes per word".

## Next Steps

1. **Source Audit**: Map which branches have reliable published grammar references vs. limited documentation
2. **Tone Notation Standard**: Establish consistent tone-marking convention across all 69 languages for commentary data
3. **Morphological Framework**: Create word-boundary and morpheme-parsing guidelines for Otomi, Trique, and high-morphology varieties
4. **Dialect Mapping**: Document which "languages" in database are actually distinct dialects requiring separate feature documentation
5. **Bible Translation Leverage**: Cross-reference active translation projects (many exist for major branches) to access native-speaker resources
