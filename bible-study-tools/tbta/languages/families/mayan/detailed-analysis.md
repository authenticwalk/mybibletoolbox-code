## Key Linguistic Features

### 1. Ergative-Absolutive Alignment

Mayan languages are characterized by ergative-absolutive case systems, a fundamental grammatical pattern that differs significantly from nominative-accusative systems found in European languages.

#### Ergative-Absolutive Pattern

In transitive clauses, Mayan languages treat:
- **Absolutive**: The object of transitive verbs and subject of intransitive verbs
- **Ergative**: The agent/subject of transitive verbs

#### Examples of Marking Patterns

```
K'iche' (quc):
  x-∅-atz'ub-a-n      ri Xwan ri li tz'i'-a
  PERF-ABS.3SG-bite-TV-ABS.3PL  ART Xwan ART DEF dog-ABS
  "Xwan bit the dog"

Kaqchikel (cak):
  x-r-aj-tik          ri ala
  PERF-ERG.3SG-go-PL  ART child
  "The child went"
```

#### Absolutive/Ergative Marking

- **Absolutive** typically marked by zero morpheme on 3rd person singular, suffixes on other persons
- **Ergative** marked by prefixes (possessed person marking)
- Both systems use person/number agreement on the verb
- Creates inverse relationship with European languages: object-like marking on intransitive subjects

#### Implications for Bible Translation

- Agent emphasis in passive constructions differs from English
- Causative constructions maintain ergative patterns
- Reflexive constructions typically delete ergative marker
- Possession treated as absolutive relationship (similar to object marking)

### 2. Numeral Classifiers

Mayan languages employ extensive classifier systems that categorize objects by shape, function, and abstract properties. Unlike many Asian languages with simple classifiers, Mayan systems integrate deeply with numerals, possession, and demonstratives.

#### Classifier Types

Mayan numeral classifiers categorize objects by shape, function, and abstract properties. Classifiers obligatorily appear with numerals in many Mayan languages [Springer: Pattern borrowing, linguistic similarity, and new categories: Numeral classifiers in Mayan]. Examples of documented classifiers include:

**Shape-Based Classifiers:**
- `tzutz` - "to complete, to end, to terminate" (found in Classic Maya hieroglyphics) [MesoWeb: The Human Hand in Classic Maya Hieroglyphic Writing]
- Various shape classifiers for long, flat, and round objects (specific forms vary by language)

**Functional Classifiers:**
- Classifiers for containers, vehicles, and handled objects
- Classifications for animate vs. inanimate entities

**Note**: Ch'orti' Mayan has documented classifiers including `chach` for "handfuls (of thin rods, hair...)" and Ch'ol uses `-p'ej` as generic classifier with numerals 1-19 [Benjamins: Semantic generalization in Ch'orti' Mayan numeral classifiers].

#### Numerical Classification Example

```
K'iche':
  junpe q'a     "one round classifier (fruit/object)"
  junp' tzutz   "one (for round objects)"
  junpik        "one (for handled objects)"

Meaning shifts based on the classified noun:
  oxche            "three (for long objects)"
  oxp'ak           "three (for flat objects)"
  oxpe q'a         "three (for general objects)"
```

#### Integration with Other Systems

- **Possession**: Possessed nouns often require appropriate classifiers
- **Definiteness**: Definite markers interact with classifier selection
- **Plurality**: Classifier form can indicate distributive vs. collective plural
- **Spatial deixis**: Demonstratives often include classifier morphemes

#### Implications for Bible Translation

- Quantity expressions require classifier selection (translators must choose appropriate classifier)
- Occurs frequently in narrative sequences ("twelve tribes," "seven churches")
- Metaphorical classifiers can shift religious meaning (e.g., abstract nouns classified as "inanimate beings")
- Translator's classifier choice affects how audiences perceive referred objects

### 3. Positional Verbs

Mayan languages possess a distinct verbal category called "positional verbs" or "positionals" that express the position, posture, or shape of objects at rest. This category is extensive and grammatically productive.

#### Core Positional Verb Functions

Positional verbs encode:
- **Static position**: Where an object is located/oriented
- **Shape of object**: The form the object takes
- **Postural configuration**: How something is arranged

#### Major Positional Classes

Positional roots denote measure functions and require derivation into stems to be used [Glossa: The roots of measurement; deGruyter: Standing divided]. Mayan languages have between 250 and 500 distinct positional roots [Wikipedia: Mayan languages]. Common semantic categories include:

**Vertical/Horizontal Position:**
- Roots for standing (tall objects, people standing)
- Roots for lying down/prone (people lying, logs)
- Roots for sitting/crouched (seated position, piled objects)
- Roots for bent/curved positions

**Container/Enclosed Position:**
- Roots for objects inside containers
- Roots for hanging/suspended objects
- Roots for strung or arranged items

**Orientation:**
- Roots for face-down/face-up positions
- Roots for leaning positions
- Roots for scattered/dispersed states

#### Grammatical Properties

Positionals function as:
- **Intransitive stative verbs** with imperfective aspect as default
- **Predicates** in copular constructions
- **Attributive modifiers** when incorporated with nouns
- **Adverbial modifiers** in certain constructions

#### Positional Construction Examples

Tzotzil positional adjectives include documented examples like `va'al` 'standing', `puch'ul` 'lying prone', and `nakal` 'at home, residing' [Wikipedia: Mayan languages]. Haviland (1992) published detailed analysis in "Seated and settled: Tzotzil verbs of the body" [Semantic Scholar].

Typical positional constructions combine aspect marking, the positional root, and locative phrases to express the configuration of objects and people in space.

#### Implications for Bible Translation

- Specific biblical scenes use exact positional relationships (Jesus sitting, standing, kneeling)
- "He sat down" requires appropriate positional verb for seated position
- Clothing, vessels, and objects in biblical narrative require accurate positional encoding
- Resurrection narrative: specific positionals mark the risen Jesus's materiality
- Implies detailed spatial awareness that English glosses over
- Religious symbolism: certain positions have metaphorical weight in Maya cosmology

### 4. Aspect-Based Tense System

Rather than a traditional tense system (past/present/future), Mayan languages organize verbal morphology around aspect—how an action unfolds. Tense (temporal location) is marked separately and less prominently.

#### Core Aspect Distinctions

**Perfective Aspect:**
- Marks completed, bounded actions
- Typically distinguished by prefix `x-` (past) or `x` + CV- reduplication
- Presents event as a single punctual or telic event
- Example: `x-∅-bat` (he/she went) - past perfective

**Imperfective Aspect:**
- Marks ongoing, habitual, or progressive actions
- Often unmarked or marked with different prefix patterns
- Presents event as open-ended, iterative, or habitual
- Example: `r-u-bat` (he/she goes) - present imperfective

**Completive Aspect:**
- Marks actions that are fully completed or perfected
- Some languages distinguish this from simple perfective
- Often indicates result state
- Example: `r-u-tz'on` (he/she has understood) - completive

#### Aspect-Tense Interaction

K'iche' is an ergative head-marking language with grammatical relations expressed through agreement morphemes on the predicate [ResearchGate: Absolutive and ergative person markers in K'iche' and Mam; SpringerLink: From enclitic to prefix]. Aspectually conditioned splits in ergative-absolutive marking are observed particularly in progressive constructions [deGruyter: Morphosyntactic features of progressive in the K'iche'an languages].

```
K'iche' Verbal Morphology:

Perfective:   x-[ERG]-[VERB]-[TV marker]-[ABS]
              "completed action marked with x-"

Imperfective: r-[ERG]-[VERB]-[ABS] OR ∅-[ABS]-[VERB]
              "habitual/ongoing actions"

Completive:   [ABS]-[VERB]-j OR other markers
              "perfected actions with result state"
```

Note: Mayanists generally agree that Mayan languages are tenseless, with aspect being primary [Academia: A Mayan temporal puzzle].

#### Temporal Reference

- **Past time**: Usually marked with perfective aspect + contextual cues
- **Present time**: Usually marked with imperfective aspect
- **Future time**: Often expressed through adverbials, modals, or imperative forms
- Aspect choice is primary; tense is secondary semantic category

#### Aspect-Based Narrative Structure

Biblical narratives in Mayan require:
- Perfective verbs for sequential mainline events (x-atz'ub, x-bat, etc.)
- Imperfective verbs for background, habitual, or customary actions
- Careful distinction between completed and ongoing actions
- Coherence maintained through aspect consistency in narrative chains

#### Examples in Bible Translation

```
"Jesus saw the disciples" (perfective - main narrative event)
"She was sitting by the well" (imperfective - background)
"He had taught them" (completive - prior completion)
```

#### Implications for Bible Translation

- Narrative mainline uses consistent perfective aspect
- Descriptive or flashback sections shift to imperfective
- Dialogue can maintain different aspect patterns than narration
- Metaphorical or theological language may use imperfective for timeless truths
- Participles and infinitives in English translate to specific aspect-marked forms
- Aspect selection changes theological emphasis (e.g., "keep [IMPERFECTIVE] watch" vs. "kept [PERFECTIVE] watch")

## Additional Linguistic Features

### Verbal Deriving Morphology

Mayan languages have productive systems for creating new verbs through affixation:
- **Causative**: `s-` prefix or other patterns (make someone do X)
- **Passive**: various suffix patterns that suppress ergative agent
- **Reflexive**: `r-` + reflexive prefix patterns (self-action)
- **Applicative**: increases valence (add beneficiary or instrument argument)

### Incorporation and Noun-Verb Binding

- Nouns can incorporate into verbs creating complex predicates
- Directional/spatial information highly integrated into verbal system
- "Positionals" are incorporated into larger verbal complexes

### Numeral System

- Vigesimal (base-20) counting system found in some languages
- Often associated with classical Mayan calendrical systems
- Some languages transitioning to base-10 under Spanish influence

### Possession Marking

- Inalienable possession (body parts, kinship): often marked on possessed noun
- Alienable possession: marked with special possessive constructions
- Some languages use classifiers in possessive marking
