# Sub-Family Specific Features

This document details the distinctive characteristics of major Austronesian sub-families represented in our dataset.

## Philippine-Type Languages

**Geographic Distribution**: Philippines (45 languages in our dataset), Taiwan (Formosan), Northern Borneo, Northern Sulawesi, Madagascar

### Key Features

1. **Four-voice system retained**: Actor, Patient, Locative, Instrumental/Benefactive
2. **Rich verbal morphology**: Extensive affixation and infixation
3. **Ang-phrase**: Marks focused/definite nouns
4. **Word order**: Predominantly VSO or VOS
5. **Complex interaction** between morphology and syntax

### Representative Languages in Dataset

Tagalog, Cebuano, Ilocano, various Manobo languages

### Translation Considerations

- Most complex voice system requires careful attention to information structure
- Rich morphology allows precise semantic distinctions
- May require multiple translation strategies for different genres (narrative vs. epistolary)

## Indonesian-Type Languages

**Geographic Distribution**: Western Indonesia (Sumatra, Java, Borneo), Malaysia

### Key Features

1. **Reduced voice system**: Two voices (from original four)
2. **Minimal inflectional morphology**: No tense or case inflection
3. **SVO word order**: Subject-Verb-Object
4. **Affixation and reduplication**: Still present for derivation
5. **Passive voice common**: Frequent use of passive constructions
6. **Noun classifiers**: Used with numbers (orang, ekor, buah)

### Representative Languages in Dataset

Indonesian, Malay

### Translation Considerations

- Simpler morphology may require more analytical constructions (helping verbs, particles)
- Passive voice may be preferred in some contexts
- Information structure conveyed more through word order than morphology

## Oceanic Languages

**Geographic Distribution**: Eastern Melanesia, Polynesia, Micronesia (109 languages in our dataset)

### Key Features

1. **Simplified voice system**: Generally two voices or no voice system
2. **Verbal particles**: Heavy reliance on preverbal particles for TAM
3. **SVO word order dominant**: Except Polynesian and Fijian (VSO)
4. **Inclusive/exclusive distinction**: Universal in first person plural
5. **Dual number marking**: 'We two', 'you two', 'they two'
6. **Five-vowel system**: Standard across family
7. **Possessive classification**: Inalienable vs. alienable (especially elaborated in Micronesian)

## Melanesian Sub-Group

**Geographic Distribution**: Most PNG + Solomon Islands languages

**Representative Languages**: Majority of PNG languages in dataset (87 languages), Solomon Islands (8 languages)

### Distinctive Features

**Causative prefix**: va-, pa-, fa- (with optional -ka, -ga)

**Transitive suffixes**: "Freely add consonantal and syllabic suffixes to verbs to make them transitive or give them more definitively transitive force" [Source: Melanesian languages research; object pronouns suffixed to verbs as transitive markers, e.g., Kwaio fai-a 'scratch it']

**Papuan influence**: SOV word order in coastal PNG areas

**Grammatical particles**: Universal use of verbal particles

### Translation Considerations

- May be most similar to Papuan neighbors in some syntactic features
- Strong influence from language contact
- Need to distinguish inherited Austronesian features from contact features

## Polynesian Sub-Group

**Representative Languages in Dataset**: Hawaiian, Tongan

### Distinctive Features

**Phonology**:
- "Scarcity of consonants and heavy use of vowels"
- Long vs. short vowels: Phonemically distinct

**Word order**: VSO (verb-initial like Fijian)

**Causative prefix**: whaka-, faka-

**Dual number**: Universal

**Particles**: Heavy reliance on particles

### Translation Considerations

- Limited consonant inventory may require loan word adaptation
- Vowel length may carry semantic distinctions
- Verb-initial order fits Hebrew narrative style naturally

## Micronesian Sub-Group

**Representative Languages in Dataset**: Chuukese, Pohnpeian, Kosraean, Mokilese, Yapese, Ulithian, Kapingamarangi

### Distinctive Features

**Phonology**: "Lack of plain labial consonants" with palatalized and labio-velarized series

**Possessive classification**: Most elaborate in Austronesian
- Categories: 'food', 'drink', 'general'
- Freestanding expressions indexed for person and number

**Object agreement**: Some languages show agreement with object [Source: Polinsky overview of Austronesian syntax; Nuclear Micronesian languages documented for object agreement]

**Dual number**: Universal

### Translation Considerations

- Labial consonant adaptation needed for Biblical names (Philip, Peter, etc.)
- Complex possessive system requires careful categorization of relationships
- May offer most nuanced possessive distinctions for theological concepts
