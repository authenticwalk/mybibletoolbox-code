## Category 1: Near Production-Ready (Refinement Needed)

### Tool 3: Web Insights ✅ Best Positioned
**Status:** 62.5% compliant (5/8 stages substantially complete)
**Key Strengths:**
- 5 adversarial experiments completed with excellent quality
- Robust frameworks developed (5-part error correction, multi-perspective, bias detection)
- Thorough documentation (16 files, 6,361 lines)

**Critical Gaps (18-28 hours):**
1. **Level 4 Usefulness Validation** (6-8 hours) ⚠️ BLOCKING
2. Three-approach comparison (not tested)
3. Review committee optimization (no tracking)

**Recommendation:** Complete Level 4 validation immediately → Production in 2-3 weeks

---

### Tool 4: Community Discussions ✅ Production-Ready Quality
**Status:** 45% compliant (quality exceptional, process needs formalization)
**Key Strengths:**
- 100% L1, 100% L2, 88% L3 validation across 3 experiments
- Robust schema (no refinements needed)
- Efficient workflow (60-70 min/word)

**Critical Gaps:**
1. **Level 4 Usefulness Validation** (4-6 hours) ⚠️ BLOCKING
2. Three-approach comparison (12-16 hours)
3. Expand test set from 3 to 30-50 words

**Recommendation:** Path A (Pilot Production) - Begin pilot in 1 week, validate during execution

---

## Category 2: Substantial Work Complete (Strategic Validation Needed)

### Tool 1: Lexicon Core ⚠️ Quality Excellent, Process Gaps
**Status:** 37.5% compliant (60+ runs completed, missing strategic validation)
**Key Strengths:**
- 60+ experimental runs (Cycles 1-4)
- 8.7-8.9/10 richness achieved
- 100% Level 1 validation
- Excellent source access (WebFetch templatable URLs)

**Critical Gaps (22 hours):**
1. No competing approaches tested (only convergence-synthesis)
2. No review committee optimization tracking
3. **Level 4 Usefulness Validation** (8 hours) ⚠️ BLOCKING
4. Missing METHODOLOGY.md

**Recommendation:** Grandfather existing work + targeted additions → Production in 3 weeks

---

### Tool 2: Scholarly Analysis ⚠️ Single-Approach Risk
**Status:** 31.3% compliant (5 excellent experiments, but all same approach)
**Key Strengths:**
- 5 experiments completed with validated quality
- All experiments passed L1-L3 validation (93-100%)
- Excellent documentation and learnings

**Critical Gaps (104-164 hours):**
1. Only 1 approach tested (journal-emphasis) - **RISK OF LOCAL MAXIMUM**
2. Need to test Approach B (commentary-synthesis) and C (primary-source-diachronic)
3. No review committee optimization
4. **Level 4 Usefulness Validation** ⚠️ BLOCKING

**Recommendation:** Test 2 competing approaches before production → 3-4 weeks

---

## Category 3: Planning Complete, Experiments Pending

### Tool 5: TBTA Hints 🔴 Planning Phase
**Status:** 18.2% compliant (excellent planning, zero experiments)
**Key Strengths:**
- Well-designed 5-step LLM logic tree architecture
- Comprehensive planning analysis (100+ KB, 5 documents)
- Clear 3-level validation framework

**Critical Gaps:**
1. **ZERO experiments conducted** (0 of 60-103 required runs)
2. METRICS.md overstates validation (claims "TESTED" with 0 experiments)
3. Test set incomplete (3 words vs 30-50 required)
4. Only 1 approach designed (need 3)

**Recommendation:** Begin Round 1 experimentation → 6-8 months to production

---

### Tool 6: Cultural Translation 🔴 Planning Phase
**Status:** 12.5% compliant (methodology designed, experiments pending)
**Key Strengths:**
- Excellent planning (834-line methodology, 1011-line pilot examples)
- Well-defined schema and quality standards
- Strategic data sources identified (900+ translations)

**Critical Gaps:**
1. No test set created (requires 30-50 words, stratified)
2. Only 1 approach designed (need 3: corpus-based, case-study, anthropological)
3. No review committee defined
4. **ZERO experiments conducted**

**Recommendation:** Complete Stage 1 preparation → 4-8 weeks to production

---

## Common Gaps Across All Tools

### 🚨 CRITICAL (Blocking Production)

**1. Level 4 Usefulness Validation (Stage 7)**
- **Tools Affected:** ALL 6 tools
- **Status:** ❌ None have completed this
- **Impact:** Cannot claim "production-ready" without practitioner validation
- **Action:** Role-play scenarios (translator, pastor, student) + "would you use this?" metrics
- **Time:** 4-8 hours per tool

**2. Three-Approach Strategic Validation (Stages 1.4, 2, 4)**
- **Tools Affected:** ALL 6 tools (all tested ≤1 approach)
- **Status:** ❌ No tool tested 3 competing approaches
- **Impact:** Risk of optimizing local maximum, not global optimum
- **Action:** Design 2 alternative approaches + Round 1 testing (9-15 runs)
- **Time:** 12-20 hours per tool

### ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY (Quality/Efficiency Improvements)

**3. Review Committee Optimization (Stages 3, 5)**
- **Tools Affected:** All 6 tools
- **Status:** ❌ No systematic reviewer tracking
- **Impact:** Cannot optimize review process, may waste effort on ineffective reviewers
- **Action:** Spawn 8-10 reviewers → track effectiveness → optimize to 3-4 focused
- **Time:** Built into experimentation rounds

**4. Improvement-Based Stopping Criteria**
- **Tools Affected:** Tools 1-4 (used percentage-based)
- **Status:** ⚠️ Partial (Tools 5-6 planned correctly)
- **Impact:** May stop too early or too late
- **Action:** Replace "80%+" with "continue until <5% improvement"
- **Time:** Retrospective documentation only

## Recommended Prioritization Strategy

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (2-4 weeks)
**Goal:** Get 2 tools to production quickly

1. **Tool 3 (Web Insights)** - Level 4 validation only → Production in 2 weeks
2. **Tool 4 (Community Discussions)** - Pilot production path → Production in 2-4 weeks

**Effort:** 20-30 hours total
**Impact:** 2 production-ready tools, immediate value delivery

---

### Phase 2: Strategic Validation (4-6 weeks)
**Goal:** Validate approaches for high-investment tools

3. **Tool 1 (Lexicon Core)** - Grandfather + targeted additions → Production in 3 weeks
4. **Tool 2 (Scholarly Analysis)** - Test competing approaches → Production in 4 weeks

**Effort:** 126-186 hours total
**Impact:** 4 tools production-ready with strategic confidence

---

### Phase 3: New Experimentation (3-8 months)
**Goal:** Execute full methodology for planning-stage tools

5. **Tool 6 (Cultural Translation)** - Complete Stage 1 → Begin experiments
6. **Tool 5 (TBTA Hints)** - Begin Round 1 experimentation

**Effort:** 6-8 months (can run in parallel)
**Impact:** All 6 tools production-ready, full suite complete

---

## Critical Questions for Decision-Making

### For Each Tool:

**1. Is Level 4 validation acceptable without multi-approach testing?**
- **Risk:** May validate a local maximum, not global optimum
- **Benefit:** Faster to production (skip 12-20 hours per tool)
- **Recommendation:** NO - multi-approach testing is strategic insurance

**2. Can we "grandfather" pre-v2.0 work with acknowledged limitations?**
- **Tools Affected:** 1-4 (all have substantial experiments completed)
- **Risk:** Documentation says "not v2.0 compliant" forever
- **Benefit:** Pragmatic, focuses effort on critical gaps
- **Recommendation:** YES - with clear limitation documentation

**3. Should planning-stage tools (5-6) start fresh with v2.0?**
- **Risk:** 6-8 month timeline
- **Benefit:** Clean implementation, no technical debt
- **Recommendation:** YES - these tools have clean slate opportunity

## Conclusion

**Overall Assessment:** Significant progress made, but no tool is fully v2.0 compliant.

**Best Path Forward:**
1. **Immediate:** Complete Level 4 validation for Tools 3-4 (1-2 weeks)
2. **Short-term:** Grandfather Tools 1-2 with targeted additions (3-4 weeks)
3. **Long-term:** Execute full v2.0 methodology for Tools 5-6 (3-8 months)

**Total Time to Full Suite Production:** 3-8 months depending on parallel execution

**Key Insight:** The new STAGES.md v2.0 methodology (tool-experimenter patterns) is significantly more rigorous than previous approaches. All tools benefit from strategic multi-approach testing and Level 4 usefulness validation before production deployment.
