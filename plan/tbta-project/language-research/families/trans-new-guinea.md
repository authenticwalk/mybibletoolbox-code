# Trans-New Guinea Language Family Research

## Executive Summary

Trans-New Guinea (TNG) is one of the world's largest language families, with probable membership of 300-500 languages, making it possibly the third-largest language family by number of languages. Of the 129 unique TNG languages in our dataset, they share significant typological features that create unique challenges and opportunities for Bible translation work. The family is characterized by complex verb morphology, including medial/final verb distinctions, switch-reference systems, clause chaining, and diverse TAM marking.

- **Region**: Primarily the interior highlands and mountains of New Guinea island

## 2. Trans-New Guinea Family Classification

### Overview
The Trans-New Guinea family classification has evolved through several proposals. The most recent comprehensive classification is by Pawley & Hammarström (2018), who accept **35 subgroups** with strong claims to TNG membership. Earlier work by Ross (2005) proposed a more conservative classification based primarily on pronominal evidence.

### The 35 Major Subgroups (Pawley & Hammarström 2018)

1. **Angan** - Eastern Highlands, Morobe, and Gulf provinces (~12 languages, ~70,000 speakers)
2. **Anim** - Southern Papua New Guinea
3. **Asmat-Kamoro** - Southern Papua, Indonesia
4. **Awin-Pa** - Western Province, PNG
5. **Bosavi** - Southern Highlands and Western Province, PNG (~6 languages including Kaluli)
6. **Chimbu-Wahgi** (Chimbu) - Chimbu and Simbu provinces (~10 languages)
7. **Dagan** - Western Province, PNG
8. **Dani** - Highlands of Papua, Indonesia (~6 languages, ~250,000 speakers)

33. **West Bomberai** - Papua, Indonesia
34. **Wiru** - Southern Highlands Province, PNG
35. **Yareban** - Central Province, PNG

### Classification Methodology
- **Lexical comparison**: Shared cognates in basic vocabulary
- **Pronominal paradigms**: Ross (2005) emphasized pronoun systems as diagnostic
- **Verb morphology**: Object prefixes and subject suffixes as key diagnostic features
- **Computational phylogenetics**: Modern approaches combine traditional comparative method with computational analysis (Greenhill 2015, TransNewGuinea.org)

### Proto-Trans-New Guinea Reconstructions
Key reconstructed features include:
- **Pronouns**: *ni "we", *ŋgi "you", *i "they"
- **Dual suffixes**: *-li and *-t
- **Plural suffix**: *-nV (n plus vowel)
- **Collective suffixes**: *-pi- (dual) and *-m- (plural)
- **Negation**: *ma- and *na
- **Object prefixes**: *n- (1sg), velar stop (2sg)

## 3. Unique Grammatical Features of Trans-New Guinea Languages

### 3.1 Verb Systems: The Core of TNG Grammar

#### Medial vs. Final Verbs (Clause Chaining)
**Definition**: One of the most distinctive features of TNG languages is the distinction between medial and final verbs in clause chains.

**Characteristics**:
- **Medial verbs**: Mark co-reference or disjoint reference of participants (switch-reference)
- **Final verbs**: Mark tense, mood, aspect, and illocutionary force
- Medial verbs often cannot be marked for full TAM categories
- Medial and final verbs have formally and functionally distinct markers

**Functional significance**:
- This tracking system maintains discourse continuity
- Highly characteristic of TNG, less common in other language families worldwide
- Creates long verb chains describing sequential events

**Translation implications**:
- Biblical narrative with sequential actions maps well to clause chains
- Care needed in translating Greek/Hebrew coordinate clauses
- May require restructuring to preserve natural discourse flow

**Examples**:
- Usan, Nungon, Ku Waru, Mian, Telefol all exhibit elaborate clause chaining
- Chains can extend for many clauses before reaching a final verb

#### Switch-Reference Systems
**Definition**: Morphological marking on medial verbs indicating whether the subject of the next clause is the same or different.

**Categories**:
- **Same-subject (SS)**: Next clause has same subject
- **Different-subject (DS)**: Next clause has different subject
- Some languages have more elaborate systems tracking multiple participants

**Translation implications**:
- Essential for maintaining participant reference in narrative
- Greek participles and conjunctions may need restructuring
- Important for translating Old Testament historical narratives
- Crucial for Gospel narratives with multiple participants interacting

**Example** (from Usan quotatives):
- *qamb* (say.SS) marks "same subject" continuation
- Used for indirect speech and "inner speech" constructions

#### Person Marking Patterns
**Diagnostic feature**: Subject-Object-Verb order with:
- **Object marking**: Verbal prefixes (n- for 1sg, velar stop for 2sg)
- **Subject marking**: Verbal suffixes
- Pattern: Object-prefix + Verb-root + Subject-suffix

**Alignment**:
- Verbal morphology typically follows **nominative-accusative** alignment
- This contrasts with ergative case marking (see below)

**Examples from languages**:
- Fore: object prefix, subject suffix
- Mian: triple-indexing (head-marking)
- Telefol: triple-indexing (head-marking)
- Fuyug: much simpler morphology
- Kimaghama: isolating (minimal morphology)

**Translation implications**:
- Greek and Hebrew person marking in verbs maps reasonably well
- Pronominal reference in translations needs careful attention
- Dual number in pronouns affects rendering of "both" or paired individuals

### 3.2 Word Order

**Basic pattern**: **Subject-Object-Verb (SOV)**
- Typologically consistent across the family
- Postpositions rather than prepositions (e.g., "town in" not "in town")
- Some languages allow relatively free word order for discourse purposes

**Translation implications**:
- Opposite of Greek/Hebrew VSO/SVO patterns
- May require complete clause restructuring
- Postpositional phrases rather than prepositional phrases
- Relative clauses typically precede head nouns

### 3.3 Case Systems

#### Ergative-Absolutive Alignment
**Pattern**: While verbal morphology is typically nominative-accusative, **case marking on nouns** commonly follows **ergative-absolutive** patterns.

**Categories**:
- **Ergative**: Marks transitive subject (agent)
- **Absolutive**: Marks intransitive subject and transitive object
- Often unmarked forms for absolutive

#### Optional Ergativity
**Key finding**: Many TNG languages show **optional ergative marking** dependent on:
- **Animacy**: More animate subjects more likely to take ergative
- **Agentivity**: More agentive/volitional actions trigger ergative
- **Focus**: Focused or contrastive subjects take ergative
- **Disambiguation**: Ergative used to avoid ambiguity

**Examples**:
- Lower Grand Valley Dani: ergative primarily for disambiguation
- Yali: optional ergative interacts with discourse prominence
- Kaluli, Ku Waru, Duna: studied for acquisition of ergative marking

**Kobon example**: No case on full nouns, but pronominal case exists (additive-quantitatively asymmetrical system)

**Translation implications**:
- Greek/Hebrew don't have ergative systems
- Agent/patient relations may need explicit marking
- Transitive/intransitive verb pairs may affect translation choices
- Important for causative constructions

### 3.4 Number Systems

**Typical distinctions**:
- **Singular**
- **Dual** (two) - very common in TNG
- **Plural** (three or more)
- **Paucal** (few) - rare, e.g., Yimas has four-way system: sg/dual/paucal/pl

**Proto-TNG reconstructions**:
- Dual: *-li, *-t
- Plural: *-nV
- Collective: *-pi- (dual), *-m- (plural)

**Distribution**:
- Number often marked on verbs rather than (or in addition to) nouns
- Some languages (like Amele) restrict number marking to kinship terms
- Many languages have minimal or optional number marking on nouns

**Translation implications**:
- Dual number very significant for pairs in Scripture (two disciples, two witnesses, etc.)
- Hebrew dual forms may map directly to TNG dual
- "Both" and "all" require careful distinction
- Collective plurals may affect rendering of group nouns

**Example**: Wantoat distinguishes singular, dual, and plural in pronouns

### 3.5 Serial Verb Constructions

**Prevalence**: Extremely common and productive in TNG languages

**Function**: Compensate for small verb root inventories
- Some languages have as few as 60 verb roots
- Serial verbs expand expressive capacity

**Types**:
1. **Causative serialization**: Using 'get' or similar verb
   - Example: Gants (Madang) uses *miŋa* 'get' for causatives
2. **Benefactive/applicative**: Using 'give' or similar
   - Benefactives typically require serial construction with 'give'
3. **Aspectual**: Grammaticalized aspect marking
   - Progressive from 'stay'
   - Completive from 'finish'
4. **Directional**: Motion verbs in series

**Translation implications**:
- Greek compound verbs may map to serial constructions
- Benefactive constructions ("for someone") require verb serialization
- Causatives need serial verb structures
- Important for translating complex events as verb sequences

**Example**: Kalam has been extensively studied for its serial verb constructions evolving from event sequences to grammatical markers (Pawley & Lane 1998)

### 3.6 Tense, Aspect, and Mood (TAM) Systems

#### Obligatory TAM Marking
- **Nuclear TNG languages**: 94.7% have obligatory TAM marking (very high rate)
- Contrasts with other small families in region: 58.3% rate

#### Tense Systems
**Multiple past tense distinctions** are extremely common:

**Examples**:
- **Amele/Kobon paradigm**:
  - Present
  - Today's past (hodiernal)
  - Yesterday's past
  - Remote past (before yesterday)
  - Habitual past
  - Future

- **Sogeram languages**:
  - Present (diachronically stable)
  - Most remote past (diachronically stable)
  - Middle past(s) (unstable, vary across languages)
  - Future (unstable)

**"Double tense" marking** (Duna, Foe):
- Simultaneous specification of perception time and event time
- Allows distinguishing when event occurred vs. when evidence was obtained

#### Aspect
- **Perfective** vs. **Imperfective** distinctions common
- Progressive often marked with grammaticalized serial verb ('stay')
- Completive aspects from verbs like 'finish'

#### Mood
- **Realis** vs. **Irrealis** distinctions widespread
- Imperative, hortative, jussive categories present
- Some languages conflate future and hortative (Koromu)

**Translation implications**:
- Greek aorist/perfect/imperfect may need multiple past tenses
- Hebrew waw-consecutive requires careful tense sequencing
- Aspectual distinctions in source texts need careful attention
- Subjunctive and optative moods map to irrealis
- Dual tense systems useful for reported events with evidential distinctions

### 3.7 Evidentiality

**The New Guinea Highlands Evidentiality Area**: A concentrated region where grammatical evidentiality is highly developed.

#### Geographic Distribution
**Languages with grammaticized evidentiality** (at least 14 identified):
- Ok-Oksapmin family
- Duna-Bogaya family
- Engan family
- East and West Kutubuan families
- Bosavi family (including Kaluli)

**Note**: Most languages on New Guinea island *lack* grammatical evidentiality, making this a remarkable areal feature.

#### Evidential Categories Attested
1. **Participatory**: Direct personal experience/involvement (underexplored category)
2. **Visual**: Direct visual evidence
3. **Sensory** (non-visual): Auditory, tactile, olfactory evidence
4. **Inferential**: Evidence from results/effects
5. **Reasoning**: Logical deduction
6. **Reportive**: Hearsay/reported information
7. **Factual**: Known facts (some languages)

#### Morphological Strategies
- **Verbal inflection**: Suffix-based systems
- **Clitics**: Separate grammatical elements
- **Particles**: Free-standing markers
- Systems range from one marked category to five+ categories

#### Interaction with Other Categories
- **Egophoricity**: Some languages (e.g., Kaluli) show egophoric marking interacting with person
- **Tense**: Double tense systems allow specifying both event time and evidence acquisition time
- **Person marking**: First vs. non-first person may affect evidential choice

**Translation implications**:
- **Critical for translation**: Evidential systems require marking information source
- Old Testament prophetic literature: requires marking of divine revelation
- Gospel narratives: eyewitness vs. reported events need distinct marking
- Epistles: distinguishing Paul's firsthand experience from transmitted teaching
- May require adding explicit evidential information not in source text
- Quotations and reported speech require careful evidential marking

**Example**: Fasu has visual evidential marked by a circumfix

### 3.8 Negation

**Common patterns**:
- Negation typically marked by **verb prefix** or **proclitic**
- Two widespread forms suggesting proto-TNG origins:
  - **mV-** forms (*ma reconstructed)
  - **nV-** forms (*na reconstructed)

**Proto-Trans-New Guinea**: *ma- and *na

**Translation implications**:
- Negative commands (prohibitions) may have distinct forms
- Double negatives may not work as in Greek
- Scope of negation may differ from source languages

### 3.9 Spatial Deixis and Directional Systems

**Elevation-based systems**: A major areal feature of TNG and broader New Guinea/Oceania

**Topographic orientation**:
- **Uphill** vs. **Downhill** distinctions grammaticalized
- Vertically-oriented spatial systems reflecting mountainous environment
- Direction of motion verbs marked for elevation change

**Examples**:

**Yupno** (Finisterre mountains, ~8,000 speakers):
- Motion verbs distinguish level vs. up vs. down movement
- **Temporal metaphor**: Uphill = future, Downhill = past
- Environment-based absolute frame of reference

**Wano** (~7,000 speakers, Papua):
- Four spatial dimensions in elevative deictics:
  1. Steepness vs. non-steepness
  2. Proximity vs. distality
  3. Adverbial vs. attributive
  4. Vertical plane

**Translation implications**:
- Directional motion ("go up to Jerusalem," "come down from the mountain") maps naturally
- Vertical spatial metaphors in Scripture align with TNG systems
- "Ascension" and "descension" language highly relevant
- May require specifying elevation change in motion verbs
- Hebrew *'alah* (go up) and *yarad* (go down) find natural equivalents

### 3.10 Possession

**Alienable vs. Inalienable Distinction**: Present in many TNG languages

**Inalienably possessed categories** (typically):
- Body parts
- Kinship terms
- Cultural relationships
- Experiential events

**Example**: **Wano** distinguishes alienable/inalienable by:
- Nominal generalization patterns
- Lexical forms
- Plurality coding differences
- Possessive construction types
- Head-role in clauses

**Extensive possessive classifier systems**:
- **Amele** (Madang): 32 classes (31 suffix allomorphy + 1 postposition class)
- **Anêm**: 20+ classes
- Mussau: 9+ classes

**Translation implications**:
- Kinship terms require inalienable constructions
- Body part metaphors must use inalienable possession
- "Son of God" likely requires kinship possession
- Possessive pronouns may require classifier choice
- Metaphorical possession ("my people," "your faith") needs appropriate marking

### 3.11 Information Structure and Discourse

#### Topic Marking
**Strategies**:
- Dedicated topic particles
- Demonstrative-based topic markers (e.g., Wambon)
- Gender/case/number marked topic markers (e.g., Nalca/Mek)

**Function**: Marks discourse topics, often clause-initial

#### Discourse Prominence and Ergativity
**Yali** (and others): Optional ergative marking operates at:
- Global discourse level (text-level prominence)
- Local discourse level (clause-level focus)
- Interaction between ergative and discourse prominence

#### Ellipsis
- Discourse often highly elliptical
- Verbal morphology provides cohesion signals
- Switch-reference and person marking track participants through elliptical clauses

**Translation implications**:
- Topic-comment structures may differ from Greek/Hebrew
- Fronting and focusing mechanisms important for emphasis
- Ellipsis patterns may allow dropping explicit subjects/objects
- Important for maintaining discourse coherence in translation

### 3.12 Quotative Constructions

**Complexity**: TNG languages show sophisticated quotation systems

**Direct vs. Indirect Speech**:

**Usan example**:
- **Direct speech**: Mono-perspectival (speaker's viewpoint only)
- **Indirect speech**: Bi-perspectival (speaker + quoted person's viewpoint)
- Grammaticalized quotative verb: *qamb* 'say.SS' (same-subject medial form)
- *qamb* exclusively used for "inner speech" and indirect quotes
- Direct speech stretches can embed within indirect quote frame

**Integration with Clause Chaining**:
- Quotative verbs integrate into medial/final verb system
- Switch-reference tracks quotation boundaries
- Reported speech in clause chains maintains participant tracking

**Translation implications**:
- **Extensive quotation in Scripture**: Requires systematic quotative strategies
- Old Testament: Extensive direct speech from God, prophets, narrative characters
- Gospels: Jesus's teaching and dialogue
- Epistles: Embedded quotations from OT
- May require explicit quotative markers beyond source text punctuation
- Indirect discourse may be preferred/required in some contexts
- Perspective marking essential for clarity

### 3.13 Additional Features

#### Reflexive and Reciprocal
- Limited data in search results
- Reciprocals may be grammaticalized (noted in Mountain Ok)
- Further research needed on reflexive systems

#### Question Formation
- Yes/no questions and content questions use different strategies
- Some languages studied: Duna ('where' questions), Makasae (apa/tai particles)
- Further research needed for comprehensive description

#### Compounding
- Both N-N and V-V compounding productive
- Clear categorial divide between nouns and verbs maintained

## 7. Recommendations for Commentary Development

### Priority Areas for Tool Development

1. **Clause Structure Tools**
   - Identify clause chains in source texts
   - Map Greek/Hebrew coordination to TNG medial/final verbs
   - Track participant reference for switch-reference marking

2. **Evidentiality Annotation**
   - For Highlands languages: Mark information source for each statement
   - Distinguish eyewitness, reported, inferential, divine revelation
   - Critical for prophetic and Gospel literature

3. **Person and Number Tracking**
   - Track dual number referents throughout passages
   - Identify transitive/intransitive verb patterns for case marking
   - Person agreement in verb morphology

4. **Spatial and Directional Marking**
   - Identify motion verbs with elevation implications
   - Mark "ascend"/"descend" language
   - Geographic movement tracking

5. **Possession Classification**
   - Mark alienable/inalienable possession contexts
   - Kinship terms requiring special treatment
   - Body part metaphors

### Language-Specific Considerations

For each TNG language translation project:
- **Determine sub-family membership** to predict likely grammatical features
- **Check for evidentiality** (especially Highlands languages)
- **Document specific TAM system** (number of past tenses, aspect categories)
- **Identify case marking pattern** (ergative optional or obligatory?)
- **Catalog serial verb constructions** for causatives, benefactives, aspect
- **Map spatial deixis system** (elevation-based or other)
- **Determine number system** (dual presence? trial? paucal?)

### Cross-Linguistic Comparison

Trans-New Guinea languages would benefit from:
- **Comparison with other SOV languages** (Turkish, Japanese, Korean) for clause structure strategies
- **Study of ergative language translations** (Basque, Georgian, Mayan languages) for case marking
- **Analysis of evidential language translations** (Tibetan, Quechua, Cherokee) for information source marking
- **Review of dual-number translations** (Slovenian, Arabic, Sanskrit) for pair rendering

## 8. Conclusion

The Trans-New Guinea language family represents one of the most linguistically diverse and typologically distinctive families in the world. With 129 languages in our dataset spanning 35 major subgroups, the family exhibits remarkable variation while maintaining core typological features: SOV word order, clause chaining with medial/final verb distinctions, switch-reference systems, and complex verbal morphology.

For Bible translation, the most challenging and significant features include:
1. Clause chaining requiring discourse restructuring
2. Evidentiality demanding explicit information source marking (Highlands area)
3. Dual number for pairs and "both" contexts
4. Multiple past tenses requiring temporal precision
5. Ergative case marking affecting agent-patient relations
6. Serial verb constructions for causatives and complex events
7. Elevation-based spatial systems for directional language

The poorstate of documentation for many languages necessitates ongoing linguistic research alongside translation work. The extensive morphological variation and discourse-level grammatical features make TNG languages particularly challenging for translators from Indo-European backgrounds but offer rich opportunities for culturally natural translation that leverages the grammatical resources these languages provide.

Bible translators working with Trans-New Guinea languages should prioritize understanding the specific grammatical profile of their target language within its sub-family context, paying special attention to the features outlined in this document that most significantly affect translation decisions.
