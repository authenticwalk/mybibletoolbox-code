- Isaiah 36:7, Malachi 3:8, Lamentations 3:48-51, Job 11:2-3

**Algorithm test**: Can the system correctly identify when "we/us/our" excludes the speaker who is reporting the quote?

### Challenge Type 2: Multi-Level Quotation (10 verses)
- Ezekiel 20:27-29, Matthew 26:59-61, Mark 14:57-59, Jeremiah 34:15-16

## Implementation Notes

### For Algorithm v2.1 Testing
- Rule 2.7 should classify hostile outsider quotes as EXCLUSIVE
- Nested quotes should apply rules at EACH level, not just outer quote
- Unclear boundaries may require AMBIGUOUS classification
- Test these verses after validating performance on existing 27-verse set

### Suggested Testing Order
1. Rule 2.7 cases first (10 verses) - tests new rule specifically
2. Nested quotes (10 verses) - tests multi-level analysis
3. Unclear boundaries (5 verses) - tests edge cases

### Expected Accuracy
- Rule 2.7 cases: Should exceed 75% (rule-based)
- Nested quotes: 60-75% (complex but analyzable)
- Unclear boundaries: 50-65% (genuinely ambiguous)
