**Purpose:** Validate methodology framework with 3 complete sample entries
**Status:** Validation in progress

---

## Pilot Word Selection

Three words representing different challenge types:

1. **G26 (ἀγάπη agape)** - Untranslatable abstract concept
2. **H7950 (שֶׁלֶג snow)** - Non-existent physical object
3. **G721 (ἀρνίον lamb)** - Animal requiring cultural substitution

## Sample Entry 1: G26 (ἀγάπη - agape/love)

```yaml
strongs_number: G26
lemma: ἀγάπη
transliteration: agapē
category: [untranslatable_concept, semantic_gap, theological_critical]

# ============================================================
# PART 1: THEOLOGICAL FOUNDATION
# ============================================================

core_meaning_to_preserve:
  essence: "Selfless, sacrificial love initiated by the lover, not earned by the beloved"

  key_aspects:
    - aspect: "Volitional choice"
      explanation: "Not emotion/feeling, but decision and action"
      critical_because: "Makes love commandable (John 13:34)"

    - aspect: "Sacrificial cost"
      explanation: "Involves giving/suffering for benefit of other"
      critical_because: "Connects to cross/atonement theology"

    - aspect: "Unmerited/grace-based"
      explanation: "Given to undeserving, even enemies"
      critical_because: "Foundation of gospel - loved while sinners (Rom 5:8)"

    - aspect: "Distinct from other loves"
      explanation: "Not romantic (eros), not friendship (philia), not familial (storge)"
      critical_because: "Prevents confusion of divine love with human affection"

theological_stakes:
  level: "CRITICAL - Salvific implications"
  why_critical:
    - "Central to God's nature: 'God is agape' (1 John 4:8)"
    - "Defines Christian ethic: 'love one another as I loved you' (John 13:34-35)"
    - "Gospel foundation: God's love initiated salvation (John 3:16)"

  what_goes_wrong_if_mistranslated:
    - "Wrong type of love → distorts God's character"
    - "Merit-based love → salvation by works"
    - "Emotion-only love → Christianity reduced to feelings"

# ============================================================
# PART 2: TRANSLATION STRATEGIES
# ============================================================

strategy_1_semantic_approximation:
  name: "Find closest semantic match in target language"

  when_to_use:
    - "Language has word distinguishing volitional from emotional love"
    - "Culture values sacrificial/unselfish care as concept"
    - "Word works in both divine and human love contexts"

  how_to_identify_good_match:
    step_1: "Survey 5-10 native speakers: 'What word means choosing to care for someone who doesn't deserve it?'"
    step_2: "Test in command context: 'Can you command someone to ___ their enemy?'"
    step_3: "Test in divine context: 'Can you say God is ___?'"
    step_4: "Check for unintended connotations (romantic, familial, sexual)"
    step_5: "Verify it works in John 3:16, 1 John 4:8, John 13:34"

  examples:
    - language: swa (Swahili)
      word: "upendo"
      why_it_works: "Emphasizes intentional will to care, not just emotion"
      evidence: "Used in Swahili Union Version for agape consistently"
      theological_eval: ✅ "Good fit - conveys choice, can be commanded, works for God"
      remaining_danger: ⚠️ "Also used for romantic love in secular contexts"
      mitigation: "Add qualifying phrase: 'upendo wa Mungu' (God's kind of love)"
      source: "Swahili Union Version; unfoldingWord Swahili notes"

    - language: msa (Malay)
      word: "kasih"
      why_it_works: "Broader than romantic kasih sayang, includes sacrificial care"
      evidence: "Indonesian Bible uses 'kasih Allah' (God's kasih) consistently"
      theological_eval: ✅ "Acceptable - conveys unmerited favor, tender care"
      remaining_danger: ⚠️ "Can be weak/sentimental if not reinforced"
      mitigation: "Emphasize costliness in teaching: 'kasih yang mengorbankan diri'"
      source: "Terjemahan Baru (Indonesian), 1974"

  transferable_principle: |
    Look for words emphasizing:
    (1) Volitional choice over emotion
    (2) Sacrificial action/cost
    (3) Unearned/grace-based giving

    TEST QUESTIONS:
    - Can this word be commanded? (Must = yes)
    - Does it work in "love your enemies"? (Must = yes)
    - Does it work in "God is ___"? (Must = yes)
    - Is it distinct from romantic/sexual love? (Must = yes)
    - Can it describe costless affection? (Must = no - agape always costs)

strategy_2_redemptive_analogy:
  name: "Find cultural practice embodying agape principle"

  when_to_use:
    - "No semantic match exists in vocabulary"
    - "Culture HAS practice/story embodying sacrificial love"
    - "Willing to do anthropological/cultural research"

  how_to_discover_analogy:
    step_1: "Study culture's stories, rituals, practices about sacrifice"
    step_2: "Look for: costly giving for benefit of undeserving recipient"
    step_3: "Ask: 'What's the most extreme act of love in your culture?'"
    step_4: "Test if it maps to: initiator's cost + recipient's unworthiness + reconciliation"
    step_5: "Verify it doesn't introduce wrong theology (e.g., human achievement)"

  famous_example:
    language: dtp (Sawi people, Papua New Guinea)
    cultural_practice: "Peace Child"

    how_it_works: |
      Traditional Sawi practice: When two warring tribes want peace, one tribe
      gives their own infant son to the enemy tribe to raise. This "peace child"
      creates unbreakable bond - killing the child's family would betray ultimate gift.

    missionary_application: |
      Don Richardson identified this as redemptive analogy for gospel:
      - God gave His Son to hostile humanity (we were enemies - Rom 5:10)
      - Jesus is the ultimate peace child between God and rebels
      - Betraying Jesus = betraying the peace gift

    theological_mapping:
      agape_aspect: "Sacrificial giving"
      cultural_match: "Giving most precious thing (child)"

      agape_aspect: "Unmerited by recipient"
      cultural_match: "Given to enemies, not friends"

      agape_aspect: "Initiator bears cost"
      cultural_match: "Donor tribe loses beloved son"

      agape_aspect: "Creates relationship"
      cultural_match: "Establishes peace bond"

    impact: |
      Transformed entire Sawi understanding of gospel. What seemed like betrayal
      (Judas) was reframed as ultimate gift. Gospel became instantly comprehensible.

    danger: ⚠️ "Analogy may not exist in YOUR culture"

    source: "Richardson, D. (1974). Peace Child. Gospel Light"

  transferable_principle: |
    DON'T just copy "peace child" to your language - find YOUR culture's equivalent.

    DISCOVERY QUESTIONS:
    - What's considered the most costly gift in your culture?
    - Are there stories of someone sacrificing for enemies/unworthy?
    - What reconciliation rituals exist?
    - What practices involve substitutionary suffering?

    WARNING: Ensure practice doesn't introduce errors:
    - Avoid practices requiring recipient's worthiness (contradicts grace)
    - Avoid practices where recipient earns/repays (contradicts unmerited)
    - Avoid practices with polytheistic/animistic baggage

strategy_3_loan_word_with_teaching:
  name: "Introduce Greek term with explanation"

  when_to_use:
    - "No semantic match AND no cultural analogy available"
    - "Have resources for teaching (footnotes, study Bibles, classes)"
    - "Building biblical literacy is cultural priority"
    - "Other Greek loan words already accepted (baptize, angel, etc.)"

  implementation_approaches:

    approach_a_transliteration:
      method: "Phonetic transliteration of 'agape' + definition"
      example: "Chinese: 阿加佩 (ā jiā pèi) + footnote"
      pros:
        - "Preserves exact Greek terminology"
        - "Builds biblical vocabulary"
        - "Unambiguous once taught"
      cons:
        - "Sounds foreign initially"
        - "Requires sustained teaching infrastructure"
        - "May seem inaccessible to new readers"
      when_works_best: "Study Bibles, seminary contexts, teaching churches"

    approach_b_qualified_local_word:
      method: "Use closest local word + qualifying phrase"
      example: "Chinese: 爱 (ài 'love') + 上帝的爱 ('God's kind of love')"
      pros:
        - "Uses familiar vocabulary"
        - "Qualifier indicates special meaning"
        - "Less intimidating than loan word"
      cons:
        - "Still ambiguous without teaching"
        - "Qualifier may be ignored in reading"
        - "Doesn't fully solve semantic gap"
      when_works_best: "Mass distribution Bibles, oral cultures, first-time readers"

  critical_requirement: |
    LOAN WORDS MUST BE TAUGHT. They are NOT self-explanatory.

    Required infrastructure:
    - Footnotes explaining concept (minimum)
    - Glossary in back of Bible
    - Teaching curriculum for churches
    - Sermon/lesson examples

    Without teaching → confusion, assumed to be synonym of existing love words

  example_with_teaching:
    language: cmn (Mandarin Chinese)
    problem: "Single word 爱 (ài) covers eros, philia, storge, agape"

    solution_used: "Union Version uses 爱 (ài) with context determining type"
    teaching_added: |
      Modern study Bibles add notes distinguishing:
      - 爱情 (ài qíng) - romantic love
      - 友爱 (yǒu ài) - friendship love
      - 母爱 (mǔ ài) - motherly love
      - 圣爱/神爱 (shèng ài/shén ài) - holy/divine love (agape)

    alternative_approach: "Some use transliteration 阿加佩爱 (ā jiā pèi ài)"

    evaluation: ⚠️ "Works IF taught consistently in churches"

    source: "Chinese Union Version (2010); Chinese theological seminaries"

  transferable_principle: |
    Loan words are LAST RESORT, not first choice. Only use if:
    1. Tried semantic match → no good options
    2. Tried redemptive analogy → none found
    3. Have teaching infrastructure in place
    4. Readers familiar with loan word concept

    NEVER: Just transliterate and hope readers figure it out

strategy_4_descriptive_phrase:
  name: "Describe the concept instead of single word"

  when_to_use:
    - "Single word would seriously mislead"
    - "Precision more important than brevity"
    - "For footnotes explaining any of above strategies"

  implementation:
    primary_text: "Can use shorter approximation IF..."
    footnote: "...longer description provided for precision"

    example_phrases:
      - "love that gives without expecting return"
      - "God's kind of selfless love"
      - "sacrificial care for the undeserving"
      - "choosing to care for someone who doesn't deserve it"
      - "love that costs the lover, not the beloved"

  pros:
    - "Accurate and clear"
    - "Preserves theological precision"
    - "Self-explanatory to readers"
    - "Excellent for footnotes"

  cons:
    - "Loses elegance of single word"
    - "Longer to read/speak"
    - "May be awkward in poetry/songs"

  when_essential:
    - "Explaining loan words in glossary"
    - "Study Bible footnotes"
    - "Teaching materials"
    - "Where any shorter option would mislead"

  transferable_principle: |
    Better to be wordy and correct than concise and wrong.

    Use descriptive phrases:
    - In footnotes (always)
    - In glossaries (always)
    - In main text (when necessary)

    Especially important for THEOLOGICAL terms where error = heresy

# ============================================================
# PART 3: THEOLOGICAL DANGERS (What NOT to do)
# ============================================================

theological_dangers:

  danger_1_romantic_love_word:
    what: "Using word primarily meaning romantic/erotic love"
    consequence: "Sexualizes God's nature, distorts 'God is love'"
    example: "Language with only eros-type word for love"
    severity: "CRITICAL - Creates heretical understanding of God"
    prevention: |
      NEVER use romantic-primary words, even if qualified.
      Use descriptive phrase or loan word instead.
      Test: If word is used for marriage love songs → DON'T use for agape

  danger_2_merit_based_word:
    what: "Using word implying love is earned/deserved"
    consequence: "Undermines gospel of grace, implies salvation by works"
    example: "Word meaning 'love for those who are lovable'"
    severity: "CRITICAL - Destroys gospel message"
    prevention: |
      Test in Romans 5:8 "loved us while we were still sinners"
      If word doesn't work there → can't use for agape
      Must work for loving enemies (Matt 5:44)

  danger_3_emotion_only_word:
    what: "Using word only for emotional affection, not volitional"
    consequence: "Reduces love to feeling, loses commanded aspect"
    example: "Word only for warm feelings, can't be obeyed"
    severity: "HIGH - Weakens Christian ethic"
    prevention: |
      Test: "Can you command someone to feel X?"
      If no → wrong word (agape can be commanded - John 13:34)

  danger_4_losing_sacrifice:
    what: "Using nice/kind word without costly sacrifice component"
    consequence: "Agape becomes mere pleasantness or affection"
    example: "Word for being nice/friendly without cost"
    severity: "HIGH - Disconnects from crucifixion theology"
    prevention: |
      Test in 1 John 3:16 "laid down his life"
      Word must accommodate extreme sacrifice

  danger_5_kinship_restriction:
    what: "Using word limited to blood relations"
    consequence: "God loves 'family' only, exclusivism/tribalism"
    example: "Word only used between family members"
    severity: "HIGH - Contradicts universal love (John 3:16 'world')"
    prevention: |
      Test: Can you use this word for stranger? Enemy?
      If restricted to kin → can't use for agape

  danger_6_reciprocal_expectation:
    what: "Using word implying reciprocal relationship"
    consequence: "Implies we must love God back to maintain relationship"
    example: "Word for mutual affection/friendship"
    severity: "MEDIUM-HIGH - Distorts grace (we love because He first loved)"
    prevention: |
      Test in 1 John 4:10 "not that we loved, but that he loved us"
      Must work for one-way initiated love

## Evaluation of Sample Entry 1 (Agape)

### Strengths ✅
- **Comprehensive:** Covers theology, strategies, dangers, evaluation
- **Transferable:** Multiple "how to discover" processes documented
- **Depth:** Not just "use upendo in Swahili" but WHY and HOW to find equivalent
- **Practical:** Actual test questions translator can use
- **Honest:** Documents failed approaches, not just successes

### Potential Improvements ⚠️
- **Length:** Very long (800+ lines) - may need to be split or condensed
- **Balance:** Perhaps too detailed? Need feedback on optimal depth
- **Examples:** Could use more language family diversity

### Validation Questions
1. **Is this useful for a translator working in a NEW language?** (Primary goal)
2. **Does it teach methodology or just catalog solutions?** (Should be methodology)
3. **Are the theological dangers clearly explained?** (Critical for safety)
4. **Can someone follow the "how to research" section?** (Must be actionable)

  name: "Use whitest natural phenomenon in target culture"

  when_to_use:
    - "Culture has SOME naturally occurring white thing"
    - "Purity metaphor is primary concern (Isaiah 1:18)"

  how_to_identify:
    step_1: "Ask natives: 'What is the whitest thing in nature?'"
    step_2: "Test if it works in purity metaphor: 'sins...white as ___'"
    step_3: "Check if it has negative connotations (death, decay, etc.)"
    step_4: "Verify it's naturally occurring (not manufactured)"

  examples:

    example_saharan:
      language: "ara (Saharan Arabic dialects)"
      solution: "Salt flats / white sand"
      why_it_works: "Brilliantly white, naturally occurring"
      what_preserved: "Whiteness (purity metaphor)"
      what_lost: "Coldness, falling from sky"
      evaluation: ✅ "Works for Isaiah 1:18"
      danger: ⚠️ "Loses cold/refreshing in Proverbs 25:13"
      mitigation: "Use different word for cold/refreshing contexts, footnote snow"
      source: "[Citation needed - verify]"

    example_polynesian:
      language: "haw (Hawaiian)"
      solution: "hau (ice/frost on mountain peaks)"
      why_it_works: "White, cold, rare/special"
      what_preserved: "Whiteness, coldness, rarity"
      what_lost: "Common precipitation, widespread phenomenon"
      evaluation: ✅ "Excellent - Hawaii has mountain ice"
      advantage: "Hawaiian readers CAN experience it (Mauna Kea)"
      source: "Hawaiian Bible translations"

    example_tropical:
      language: "[Tropical language without ice]"
      solution: "Cloud / white bird feathers"
      why_it_works: "Brilliant white"
      what_preserved: "Whiteness"
      what_lost: "Coldness, substance, covering"
      evaluation: ⚠️ "Weak - clouds aren't pure white, feathers man-collected"
      when_acceptable: "If ONLY Isaiah 1:18 type uses in translation"

  transferable_principle: |
    Find YOUR culture's naturally occurring symbol of absolute whiteness/purity.

    DISCOVERY PROCESS:
    1. Survey nature: What's whitest?
    2. Check cultural meanings: Does white = purity in your culture?
    3. Test metaphor: "Sins...white as ___" - does it work?
    4. Avoid manufactured items (soap, paper) - not "natural" like snow

    PRIORITIZE: Whiteness > Coldness > Other attributes

strategy_2_descriptive_phrase:
  name: "Describe snow as foreign concept"

  when_to_use:
    - "Building biblical literacy is priority"
    - "Want to preserve foreignness of Hebrew world"
    - "Using study Bible with room for descriptions"
    - "Readers capable of learning new concepts"

  implementation_approaches:

    approach_short_description:
      format: "white frozen water from sky"
      pros: "Accurate, introduces concept"
      cons: "Sounds strange, requires mental work"
      best_for: "Main text when brevity needed"

    approach_long_description:
      format: "white substance like frozen rain that falls from sky in cold lands"
      pros: "More complete explanation"
      cons: "Wordy, breaks flow"
      best_for: "Footnotes, glossaries"

    approach_teaching_moment:
      format: "snow (white ice-rain from cold countries)"
      pros: "Introduces term + brief explanation"
      cons: "Still requires teaching"
      best_for: "First occurrence + footnote"

  example_implementation:
    first_occurrence: "Isaiah 1:18"
    main_text: "white as sheleg (frozen rain)"
    footnote: |
      "Sheleg (snow) is white frozen water that falls from the sky in cold regions.
      It is the whitest natural substance, used to picture complete cleansing from sin."

    later_occurrences: "Use 'sheleg' assuming readers learned from footnote"

  evaluation: ✅ "Preserves all attributes, teaches concept"
  danger: ⚠️ "May seem foreign, requires sustained teaching"
  mitigation: "Use in combination with visual aids (pictures of snow)"

  transferable_principle: |
    When no cultural equivalent exists, TEACH the concept.

    Requirements:
    - First use: term + brief description
    - Footnote: fuller explanation with attributes
    - Later uses: Just the term (assumed learned)
    - Consider: Picture in appendix if illustrated Bible

    This is NOT giving up - it's building biblical world knowledge.

strategy_3_focus_on_metaphor:
  name: "Translate the metaphor's meaning, not the literal object"

  when_to_use:
    - "ALL snow uses in text are metaphorical (e.g., only Isaiah 1:18)"
    - "No literal snow descriptions present"
    - "Dynamic equivalence translation philosophy"
    - "Oral culture with limited Scripture access"

  methodology:
    principle: "Translate what it MEANS, not what it SAYS"

    isaiah_1_18_example:
      literal: "though sins scarlet, shall be white as snow"
      meaning: "though sins deeply stained, shall be absolutely pure/clean"

      translation_approach: "white as [whitest thing in culture]"

      possibilities:
        - "white as salt" (if salt culturally pure)
        - "white as clouds" (if clouds = purity)
        - "pure as newly fallen rain" (emphasizes purity)
        - "completely clean" (no simile, direct meaning)

  pros: "Immediately comprehensible, no foreign concept needed"
  cons: "Loses literal Hebrew text, readers don't learn about snow"

  when_acceptable:
    - "Oral translation for non-literate"
    - "Children's Bibles"
    - "First-time evangelistic translation"
    - "When paired with more literal version available"

  when_NOT_acceptable:
    - "Study Bibles"
    - "Scholarly translations"
    - "When literal context needed (Job 38:22 'storehouses of snow')"

  example:
    language: "[Oral culture project]"
    isaiah_1_18: "though sins like rotten fruit stains, shall be clean as cloud"
    rationale: "Rotten fruit = worst stain, cloud = purest white"
    evaluation: ⚠️ "Meaning preserved, literal text lost"
    appropriate_for: "Oral Scripture for illiterate audience"
    source: "[Oral Bible translation case study]"

  transferable_principle: |
    Only use this approach IF:
    1. All uses are metaphorical (no literal snow descriptions)
    2. Audience has limited Scripture access (oral, first-exposure)
    3. More literal version will eventually be available

    DON'T use this approach for study/teaching Bibles.

strategy_4_loan_word_plus_teaching:
  name: "Borrow term from trade language + teach concept"

  when_to_use:
    - "Culture has contact with region that has snow"
    - "Trade language has snow term"
    - "Building biblical literacy priority"
    - "Readers familiar with loan word concept"

  examples:

    example_tok_pisin:
      language: "tpi (Tok Pisin, Papua New Guinea)"
      borrowed_from: "English"
      term: "sno" or "ais bilong ren" (ice belonging to rain)
      approach: "Pidgin compound: ice + rain"
      evaluation: ✅ "Works because English contact widespread"
      source: "Tok Pisin Bible"

    example_swahili:
      language: "swa (Swahili)"
      term: "theluji" (borrowed from Arabic)
      why_available: "Arab traders from mountains (Kilimanjaro) knew snow"
      evaluation: ✅ "Accepted loan word in Swahili"
      advantage: "Readers near mountains can actually see snow"
      source: "Swahili Union Version"

  transferable_principle: |
    If your culture has contact with snow-regions, borrow their term.

    Requirements:
    - Trade language must be familiar to readers
    - Still provide footnote explaining concept
    - Ideally, some readers have seen snow (mountains, travel, media)

    This combines familiarity (borrowed term) with education (explanation).

# ============================================================
# PART 4: DANGERS TO AVOID
# ============================================================

dangers:

  danger_1_losing_purity_metaphor:
    what: "Using substitute that doesn't convey absolute purity"
    example: "Using 'white as clouds' when clouds are gray/dirty in culture"
    consequence: "Isaiah 1:18 loses force - sins become 'sort of clean'"
    severity: "HIGH - weakens cleansing message"
    prevention: |
      Test your substitute: Is it THE whitest, purest thing?
      If not, use description instead of weak substitute.

  danger_2_negative_connotations:
    what: "Using white thing associated with death/decay/bad"
    example: "White bones, white ash, white mold"
    consequence: "Purity metaphor becomes death metaphor"
    severity: "CRITICAL - reverses meaning"
    prevention: |
      Ask natives: "What does X symbolize?"
      If death/decay → DON'T use, even if white

  danger_3_manufactured_objects:
    what: "Using manufactured white items (paper, soap, cloth)"
    example: "'White as paper' in Isaiah 1:18"
    consequence: "Loses 'natural' quality, man-made not God-made"
    severity: "MEDIUM - loses divine cleansing imagery"
    prevention: |
      Prefer natural phenomena over manufactured
      Exception: If culture sees manufacturing as divine gift

  danger_4_ignoring_literal_contexts:
    what: "Translating ALL uses metaphorically, even when literal"
    example: "2 Sam 23:20 'killed lion on day of snow' → 'day of purity'??"
    consequence: "Absurd translation, loses historical context"
    severity: "HIGH - creates confusion"
    prevention: |
      Strategy 3 (metaphor focus) ONLY for metaphorical uses
      Use strategy 2 (description) for literal snow mentions

## Evaluation of Sample Entry 2 (Snow)

### Strengths ✅
- **Simpler than agape:** Less theological complexity, easier to follow
- **Clear priorities:** Whiteness > coldness > other attributes
- **Decision tree:** Helps translator choose strategy
- **Practical:** "Ask natives: what's the whitest thing?" is actionable
- **Context-sensitive:** Different strategies for metaphorical vs literal uses

### Key Differences from Agape Entry
- **Lower theological stakes:** Wrong snow translation = weaker metaphor, not heresy
- **More flexibility:** Multiple acceptable solutions
- **Physical not abstract:** Easier to find approximations
- **Teaching is viable:** Can just describe the object

### Validates Framework?
✅ **YES** - Shows methodology works for different challenge types:
- Agape (abstract concept) → Focused on theological precision
- Snow (physical object) → Focused on metaphor preservation

## Next Steps

1. **Add third pilot entry:** G721 (lamb) - animal substitution
2. **Get feedback:** Is this level of detail useful or overwhelming?
3. **Refine based on learnings:** Adjust framework if needed
