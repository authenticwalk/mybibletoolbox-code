## European Languages (T-V Distinction)

### Indo-European T-V Systems

**Status**: Moderate complexity, widespread across branches

**What is T-V Distinction?**:
- From Latin "tu/vos" - familiar vs. formal second-person pronouns
- Marks social distance, respect, intimacy, and power relationships
- **Critical**: Biblical passages require translator decisions about formality level

#### Romance Languages

**French (fra)**:
- **tu** (familiar): Friends, family, children, peers, intimate prayer
- **vous** (formal/plural): Strangers, superiors, elders, traditional God-address
- Traditional Bible translations: Always vous to God (reverence)
- Modern debate: tu to God (intimacy) vs. vous (respect)

**Spanish (spa)**:
- **tú** (familiar): Friends, family, informal contexts
- **usted** (formal): Strangers, superiors, elders, formal contexts
- Regional variation: Latin America vs. Spain usage differs
- Biblical translation: Jesus-disciples (tú), Jesus-Pharisees (may vary), prayer to God (usted traditional)

**Portuguese (por)**:
- **tu** (familiar): Informal relationships
- **você** (semi-formal): General polite form
- **o senhor/a senhora** (very formal): High respect
- Brazil vs. Portugal: Different usage patterns

**Italian (ita)**:
- **tu** (familiar): Friends, family, informal
- **Lei** (formal): Strangers, superiors, formal contexts
- Less rigid than French, but still significant in religious contexts

#### Germanic Languages

**German (deu)**:
- **du** (familiar): Friends, family, children, some modern workplaces
- **Sie** (formal): Strangers, superiors, formal contexts
- **Lutheran influence**: Luther used "du" for God (intimate relationship with Father)
- Modern German Bibles: Mix of du (intimacy) and Sie (reverence) depending on tradition

**Dutch (nld)**:
- **jij** (familiar): Informal relationships
- **u** (formal): Formal, respectful address

#### Slavic Languages

**Russian (rus)**:
- **ты (ty)** (familiar): Friends, family, children, intimate contexts
- **вы (vy)** (formal/plural): Strangers, superiors, respectful address
- Growing debate: ты vs. вы in prayer to God
- Traditional: вы (reverence); Charismatic/modern: ты (intimacy)

**Polish (pol)**:
- **ty** (familiar): Informal relationships
- **pan/pani** (formal): Mr./Mrs. + formal address
- Complex honorific particles with formal address

**Czech (ces)**:
- **ty** (familiar): Friends, family
- **vy** (formal): Respectful, formal contexts

#### Biblical Translation Implications

**Critical Decision Points**:

1. **Jesus addressing disciples**:
   - Familiar (tu/du/ты) - intimate relationship
   - Shows closeness, teaching authority without formality

2. **Jesus addressing Pharisees**:
   - May shift to formal (vous/Sie/вы) in confrontation
   - Or remain familiar (tu) as sovereign disregard for their claimed status
   - Translation choice affects tone of rebuke

3. **Prayer to God**:
   - **Traditional**: Formal (vous/Sie/вы) - reverence, transcendence
   - **Modern/Informal**: Familiar (tu/du/ты) - intimacy, relationship
   - **Theological implications**:
     - Formal = God as distant, holy, to be revered
     - Familiar = God as Father, intimate, relational

4. **God addressing humans**:
   - Typically familiar (tu) - sovereign intimacy
   - God condescends to intimate relationship

5. **Social hierarchy in parables**:
   - Masters/servants: Master uses tu (down), servant uses vous (up)
   - Parents/children: Varies by culture
   - Elders/youth: Youth uses formal upward

**Cultural Variation by Language**:
- **French**: Strong formal tradition, vous to God nearly universal historically
- **German**: Protestant (du to God), Catholic (Sie to God) split
- **Spanish**: Regional variation, Latin America more formal than Spain
- **Russian**: Active debate, generational shift toward familiar ты

## African Languages (Age-Based Kinship)

### Niger-Congo Age Distinctions

**Status**: Obligatory in most Bantu and related languages

**What Are Age-Based Kinship Terms?**:
- Grammatical requirement to specify relative age in kinship relationships
- Cannot simply say "brother" - must specify older or younger
- Affects translation of all sibling relationships in Bible

#### Swahili and Bantu Languages

**Swahili (swa)**:
- **kaka** (older brother) vs. younger brother (different term)
- **dada** (older sister) vs. younger sister (different term)
- Age distinction OBLIGATORY in kinship vocabulary
- Cannot use generic "sibling" term

**Other Bantu Languages** (Zulu, Xhosa, Sesotho, etc.):
- Similar age-based kinship systems across family
- Extensive kinship terminology distinguishing:
  - Mother's brothers vs. father's brothers (different words)
  - Age order among siblings
  - Generation levels (grandparent, parent, child, grandchild specific terms)

#### Biblical Translation Implications

**Challenge**: Greek/Hebrew "adelphos" (brother) is age-neutral

**Translation Decisions Required**:

1. **Jesus and his brothers** (Matt 13:55):
   - Must specify if James, Joses, Simon, Judas are older or younger than Jesus
   - Theological implications: If older brothers, why is Jesus head? If younger, fits primacy

2. **Peter and Andrew** (Matt 4:18):
   - "Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother"
   - Must specify: older or younger brother?
   - Cultural implications: Authority and respect affected by age order

3. **James and John** (sons of Zebedee):
   - Age order affects understanding of "sons of thunder" dynamics
   - Which brother asked for position at Jesus' right hand?

4. **"Love your brother"** commands:
   - Generic or specific age? Affects application
   - May require two translations: "love your older brother" and "love your younger brother"

5. **Spiritual brotherhood** (Christians as brothers):
   - How to express age-neutral spiritual kinship in age-specific language?
   - May use generic person term + qualifier "in Christ" to bypass kinship age-marking

**Translation Strategies**:
- **Historical research**: Determine actual age order from extrabiblical sources where possible
- **Cultural notes**: Include footnotes explaining age ambiguity in source text
- **Generic terms**: Use non-kinship terms for spiritual brotherhood to avoid age-marking
- **Multiple renderings**: Provide both older/younger options with cultural context

**Cultural Considerations**:
- Respect for elders encoded grammatically
- Younger siblings expected to show deference
- Authority structures affected by age order
- Family hierarchy more explicit than in Western cultures

  sociolinguistic_markers:
    - age_differential: "Critical - requires register shift"
    - status_relationship: "Critical - requires form selection"
    - gender: "Significant - affects particle and verb choice"
    - context: "Important - formal settings require keigo"
```

### Translation Quality Checkpoints

1. **Age Verification**: Are character relationships honored in register selection?
2. **Status Confirmation**: Do authority figures and subordinates use appropriate forms?
3. **Politeness Appropriateness**: Does register match the situation and social context?
4. **Gender Consistency**: Are gender-based speech patterns appropriately applied (where relevant)?
5. **Cultural Authenticity**: Does translation reflect target culture's actual speech norms?

### Tool Development Priorities

Based on language complexity and coverage in TBTA:

**Phase 1** (Highest Priority):
- Japanese (jpn) - Most complex, most documentation available
- Korean (kor) - Equally complex, critical for East Asian audience
- Mandarin Chinese (cmn) - Large audience, moderate complexity

**Phase 2** (High Priority):
- Thai (tha) - Significant complexity, important Southeast Asian language
- Vietnamese (vie) - Moderate complexity, large audience
- Indonesian (ind) - Less complex but important regional language

**Phase 3** (Medium Priority):
- Hindi (hin) - Large audience, moderate complexity
- Bengali (ben) - Large audience, moderate complexity
- Dravidian languages (tam, tel, mal) - Moderate complexity, South Asian importance

**Phase 4** (Reference/Research):
- Hebrew (heb) - Already present in Biblical texts
- Arabic (arb) - Complex but diglossic situation complicates implementation
- Tagalog (tgl) - Growing Philippine Christian market
- Sanskrit (san) - Academic/scholarly value

### Notes for Tool Creators

1. **Reference Biblical parallels**: When in doubt about register appropriateness, check how the original Hebrew/Greek handled similar social relationships

2. **Cultural consultation**: Each language tool should ideally have input from native speakers familiar with both Bible and that language's register system

3. **Iterative validation**: Register systems are culturally nuanced - tools should include feedback mechanisms for community validation

4. **Documentation requirements**: Every register system needs:
   - Clear examples from existing translations
   - Guidance on character differentiation
   - Age/status relationship matrices
   - Particle/affix usage patterns
   - Context appropriateness guidelines

5. **Edge cases**: Religious/sacred language often follows different rules:
   - Prayer language may use archaic forms
   - Divine address may use unique registers
   - Prophetic language may transcend normal social rules
   - These need explicit documentation per language
