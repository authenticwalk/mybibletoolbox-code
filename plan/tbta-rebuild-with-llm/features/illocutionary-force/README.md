# Illocutionary Force in TBTA Languages

## Overview

**Illocutionary Force** is a clause-level feature that categorizes the speech act type being performed. While English primarily marks speech acts through syntactic mood (declarative, interrogative, imperative) and punctuation, most world languages use additional grammatical and phonological resources to explicitly encode what the speaker is doing with the utterance—whether asserting, questioning, commanding, or exhorting.

This document explores how TBTA languages mark illocutionary force and why these distinctions are critical for accurate Bible translation.

## Theoretical Foundation: Speech Act Theory

### What is Illocutionary Force?

Illocutionary force is the pragmatic effect or communicative intent of an utterance—what the speaker is doing *by* saying something, not just what they're saying.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Locutionary Act**: What is literally said (the propositional content)
2. **Illocutionary Act**: What is done by saying it (the speech act)
3. **Perlocutionary Act**: The effect on the listener

**Example:**
- Locutionary: "Can you close the door?"
- Illocutionary Force: Command (not genuinely asking ability)
- Perlocutionary Effect: Listener closes the door

### Searle's Basic Speech Act Categories

Searle (1979) identified five fundamental speech act types, which align closely with TBTA's illocutionary force values:

1. **Assertives** (Representatives): Committing speaker to truth → `Declarative`
2. **Directives**: Attempting to get hearer to do something → `Imperative`, `Hortative`
3. **Commissives**: Committing speaker to future action → `Declarative` (typically)
4. **Expressives**: Expressing attitudes/emotions → `Exclamative`
5. **Declarations**: Bringing about change in world → `Declarative`

## TBTA Illocutionary Force Categories

### Declarative
**Definition**: Statement of fact; the speaker asserts a proposition as true.

**Characteristics:**
- Words-to-world fit: Language describes how things are/were/will be
- Canonical form: Subject-Verb-Object or similar
- Truth-apt: Can be true or false
- No explicit mood marking in many languages

**Examples:**
- "Jesus healed the sick" (statement of fact)
- "The kingdom of God is at hand" (assertion)
- "I believe in Jesus Christ" (statement of conviction)

**Bible Examples:**
- Matthew 3:2: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" (with imperative force, but propositions are declarative)
- John 1:1: "In the beginning was the Word" (pure declarative)

**Language-Specific Marking:**
- **English**: Unmarked; relies on word order and context
- **Japanese**: No particle; sentence-final pitch pattern (falling)
- **Mandarin Chinese**: Optional le (了) for completed action

**Translator's Note:**
Most declarations need no special marking; however, some languages distinguish between simple assertions and emphatic statements, or between recently-learned vs. long-known facts.

---

### Interrogative (Generic)
**Definition**: Question; the speaker is requesting information and expects a response.

**Characteristics:**
- World-to-words fit: Language seeks information about how things are/were/will be
- Inversion common (English: "Do you believe?")
- Grammatically or phonologically marked in most languages
- Requires response for completion

**Note**: TBTA further subdivides into Yes-No and Wh-Interrogative

---

### Yes-No Interrogative
**Definition**: Polar question expecting "yes" or "no" (or equivalent) response.

**Characteristics:**
- Binary expected response
- Marked by inversion, particles, or intonation
- Propositional content identical to declarative counterpart
- Distinction purely pragmatic/formal

**Examples:**
- "Do you believe in Jesus?" (expecting yes/no)
- "Will you follow me?" (commands while questioning)
- "Is the kingdom of God at hand?" (seeking confirmation)

**Bible Examples:**
- Matthew 19:17: "Why do you ask me about what is good?" (question within narrative)
- John 3:2: "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher..." (actually an assertive, despite question-like syntax)

**Language-Specific Marking:**

| Language Family | Marking Strategy | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **East Asian** | Sentence-final particle | Japanese か (ka); Mandarin 嗎 (ma); Korean -니 (ni) |
| **Indo-European** | Inversion + intonation | English "Do you...?"; Spanish "¿Hablas español?" |
| **Austronesian** | Particles + intonation | Tagalog ba; Indonesian ya; Malay ka |
| **Slavic** | Particles | Russian ли (li); Polish czy |
| **Sino-Tibetan** | Particles | Tibetan -khe; Burmese -me |

**Translator's Note:**
Some languages use identical marking for yes/no and content questions; others distinguish them clearly. Some mark yes/no questions but leave them unmarked in dependent clauses.

---

### Wh-Interrogative
**Definition**: Content question requesting specific information (who, what, when, where, why, how).

**Characteristics:**
- Expects non-binary answer
- Fronted question word (wh-element) in many languages
- Some languages use identical marking to yes/no questions
- Expresses assumption that answer exists

**Examples:**
- "Who is Jesus?" (seeking identity)
- "When will the kingdom come?" (seeking temporal information)
- "How should we live?" (seeking manner/method)

**Bible Examples:**
- John 1:38: "What are you seeking?" (seeking purpose)
- Matthew 21:28: "What do you think?" (seeking opinion)
- Luke 24:38: "Why are you troubled?" (seeking cause)

**Language-Specific Marking:**

| Language | Marking | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **English** | Fronted wh- word | "What do you want?" |
| **Japanese** | In-situ wh- + か (ka) | "Anata wa nani o hoshii desu ka?" (You what want?) |
| **Mandarin** | In-situ wh- word | "你想什么?" (nǐ xiǎng shénme = You want what?) |
| **Spanish** | Fronted qué/quién/cuándo | "¿Qué quieres?" |
| **Tagalog** | Fronted word + -ang marking | "Ano ang gusto mo?" |
| **Swahili** | Fronted question word | "Nani anasema?" (Who is speaking?) |

**Translator's Note:**
Many languages place question words in-situ (in original position) rather than fronting them. This doesn't reduce interrogative force but reflects different information structure constraints.

---

### Imperative
**Definition**: Command; the speaker is directing the hearer to perform an action.

**Characteristics:**
- World-to-words fit: Hearer must change world to match propositional content
- Typically second-person subject (often null/pro-drop)
- Marked by special verb forms or particles
- Speaker gives hearer "no option but to comply" (Searle)
- Politeness, register, and formality strongly affect form choice

**Examples:**
- "Repent!" (command to change behavior)
- "Follow me" (command to accompany)
- "Do not kill" (negative command)
- "Love your neighbor" (command to emotion/attitude)

**Bible Examples:**
- Matthew 4:10: "Worship the Lord your God and serve him only" (imperative)
- Matthew 28:19: "Go and make disciples of all nations" (imperative)
- Matthew 5:44: "Love your enemies" (imperative, despite challenging emotional content)

**Language-Specific Marking:**

| Language | Form | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **English** | Bare verb | "Go home!" |
| **Spanish** | Special conjugation | "¡Vete!" (formal), "¡Vamos!" (plural) |
| **Mandarin** | Optional particle 吧 (ba) | "去吧" (qù ba = go SFP) |
| **Japanese** | -e/-ro/-nasai forms | "行け" (ike = go IMPERATIVE); honorific "いらっしゃってください" (rasshai-te kudasai) |
| **German** | Special form | "Geh!" (informal), "Gehen Sie!" (formal) |
| **Russian** | Perfective aspect + -Ø | "Читай книгу" (Read the book!) |
| **Tagalog** | Mag- prefix | "Magbasa!" (Read!) |
| **Swahili** | Verb stem | "Jifunze" (Learn!); "Jifunzeni" (Learn! plural) |

**Politeness and Register:**
Imperatives show dramatic variation by politeness level:

- **Direct**: "Go!" (bare form, potentially rude)
- **Polite**: "Could you go?" (interrogative form with imperative force)
- **Honorific**: "Would the honored guest please go?" (Japanese: "いらっしゃってください")
- **Passive**: "It would be good if you went" (declarative with imperative force)

**Translator's Note:**
Bible languages (Greek, Hebrew) often use imperative mood, but target languages may prefer polite or indirect forms. Some languages require explicit agent marking even though imperative implies second person. Register choices affect reader reception.

---

### Hortative
**Definition**: Exhortation or invitation; the speaker is proposing or inviting a course of action, often including themselves (first-person plural).

**Characteristics:**
- Typically first-person plural (inclusive)
- "Let us..." structure in English
- Milder than direct command
- Invites cooperation/agreement
- Often used in sermons, prayers, proposals

**Examples:**
- "Let us go to Bethlehem" (invitation)
- "Let us love one another" (exhortation)
- "Come, follow me" (invitation despite second-person form in English)

**Bible Examples:**
- 1 John 4:7: "Let us love one another" (clear hortative)
- Luke 15:23: "Let us celebrate with a feast" (invitation)
- John 11:11-12: "Let us go back to Judea" (proposal)

**Language-Specific Marking:**

| Language | Form | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **English** | "Let us/Let's" | "Let us pray" |
| **Spanish** | "Vamos a..." or special form | "¡Vamos!" (Let's go) |
| **Mandarin** | 让我们 (ràng wǒmen = let us) | "让我们去吧" (Let us go) |
| **Quechua** | -yachun (hortative suffix) | "Ritiyachun" (Let's go) |
| **Swahili** | Tuma + verb | "Tuende" (Let's go) |
| **Tagalog** | Tayo/Kayo forms | "Tayo ay magpray" (Let's pray) |

**Translator's Note:**
Hortative is distinct from imperative in encouraging rather than commanding. Some languages grammaticalize this distinction; others treat it as a pragmatic variant of imperative. Critical when representing church exhortations and community prayer calls.

---

### Exclamative
**Definition**: Exclamation; the speaker is expressing strong emotion or surprise about a proposition.

**Characteristics:**
- Often involves degree/intensity (how much, how good, how surprising)
- Marked by special particles, intonation, or syntax
- Not truth-conditional like assertions
- Emphasizes emotional response over propositional content
- Can co-occur with other force types

**Examples:**
- "How great is God!" (expressing amazement)
- "What a kingdom!" (expressing wonder)
- "Oh, the depths of God's wisdom!" (expressing awe)

**Bible Examples:**
- Romans 11:33: "Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!" (exclamation of awe)
- 1 Corinthians 15:55: "Where, O death, is your victory?" (exclamation of triumph)
- Psalm 23:1: "The LORD is my shepherd" (can be read as exclamative emphasis)

**Language-Specific Marking:**

| Language | Form | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **English** | Intonation + "What/How" + exclamation mark | "What a wonderful day!" |
| **Spanish** | ¡Qué...! | "¡Qué hermoso!" (How beautiful!) |
| **Mandarin** | Particles 呢 (ne) 多 (duō) | "多好啊!" (duō hǎo a = how good SFP) |
| **Japanese** | -naa/-na particles, intonation | "素晴らしいなあ!" (subarashii naa = wonderful EXCL) |
| **German** | Inversion + particle | "Was für ein wunderbarer Tag!" |
| **Russian** | Special particles ж (zh), же | "Какой чудесный день!" |

**Translator's Note:**
Exclamatives in Hebrew often use interrogative forms (e.g., "How can this be?") but with exclamative force. Greek also uses rhetorical questions as exclamations. Target language may require explicit exclamative marking.

## Quick Translator Test

Answer these questions about your target language:

1. ☐ Does your language mark questions with particles or intonation only?
2. ☐ Does your language have distinct imperative verb forms?
3. ☐ Does your language use sentence-final particles for speech acts? (e.g., Japanese ne, yo, ka)
4. ☐ Does your language mark performatives specially? (I hereby declare, bless, curse)
5. ☐ How does your language distinguish direct from indirect commands?

If you answered YES to #3 (sentence-final particles), illocutionary force
annotation is CRITICAL for correct particle selection.

**Languages requiring this**:
- East Asian: Japanese, Korean, Mandarin (sentence particles)
- Southeast Asian: Thai, Vietnamese, Malay (particles)
- Bantu: Many use tone/particles for illocutionary marking

## Hierarchical Prediction Prompt Template

**Level 1 - Check Morphological Marking**
Prompt: "Does the verb form explicitly mark illocutionary force?"
- Greek: Imperative mood → **Imperative Force**
- Hebrew: Imperative, Jussive, Cohortative → **Imperative Force**
- Interrogative pronouns (who, what, why) → **Interrogative Force**
- If explicit → Done. If not → Continue Level 2

**Level 2 - Syntactic Patterns**
Prompt: "What syntactic pattern indicates the speech act?"
- Question word order (inversion) → **Interrogative Force**
- Performative verb (I declare, promise, swear) → **Performative Force**
- Standard SVO/VSO order → **Declarative Force** (default)

**Level 3 - Discourse Context**
Prompt: "What is the speaker trying to achieve?"
- Requesting information → **Interrogative Force**
- Commanding action → **Imperative Force**
- Stating facts → **Declarative Force**
- Making something true by speaking → **Performative Force**

**Level 4 - Speech Act Theory Application**
Apply Searle's categories:
- Assertives (state beliefs) → **Declarative**
- Directives (get hearer to do something) → **Imperative**
- Commissives (commit speaker to action) → **Commissive Force**
- Expressives (express psychological state) → **Expressive Force**
- Declarations (create new reality) → **Performative Force**

**Level 5 - Pragmatic Inference**
Prompt: "Could this be indirect speech act?"
- Polite question functioning as command → Still **Imperative Force**
- Example: "Can you pass the salt?" (form=question, force=command)

## Gateway Features & Correlations

Quick prediction rules:

| If Clause Contains... | Then Predict... | Confidence |
|----------------------|----------------|------------|
| Imperative verb form | **Imperative Force** | 95%+ |
| Interrogative pronoun (who, what, why) | **Interrogative Force** | 95%+ |
| Question particle (Greek ἆρα, οὐ, μή) | **Interrogative Force** | 95%+ |
| Performative verb (declare, bless, swear) | **Performative Force** | 90%+ |
| Optative mood (Greek) | **Optative Force** (wish) | 95%+ |
| Standard indicative statement | **Declarative Force** | 85%+ (default) |

**Correlation with Mood**:
- Imperative Mood → 100% Imperative Force
- Optative Mood → 100% Optative Force
- Subjunctive Mood → Mixed (check context)
- Indicative Mood → Usually Declarative Force (90%+)

---

## Common Prediction Errors

**Error 1**: Confusing grammatical mood with illocutionary force
- Problem: Indicative mood can have imperative force
- Solution: Check discourse function, not just verb form
- Example: "You will honor your father" (form=indicative, force=imperative)

**Error 2**: Missing indirect speech acts
- Problem: Polite questions functioning as commands
- Solution: Analyze speaker intent and context
- Example: "Would you mind closing the door?" (form=question, force=command)

**Error 3**: Confusing rhetorical vs genuine questions
- Problem: Both use interrogative form
- Solution: Check if answer is expected or point is being made
- Example: "Who can stand before God?" (rhetorical, may mark as Declarative)

**Error 4**: Not recognizing performatives
- Problem: Missing "I hereby X" patterns
- Solution: Check for performative verbs in 1st person
- Example: "I forgive you" (creates forgiveness by speaking)

---

## Cross-Feature Interactions

**Illocutionary Force + Mood**:
- Strong correlation: Imperative mood → Imperative force (100%)
- Optative mood → Optative/wish force (100%)
- Indicative mood → Usually Declarative force (90%+)
- Subjunctive mood → Context-dependent

**Illocutionary Force + Genre**:
- Narrative: More Declarative (describing events)
- Teaching: Mix of Declarative + Imperative (doctrine + exhortation)
- Prophecy: High Performative (oracular speech)
- Law: High Imperative (commands) + Declarative (statutes)

**Illocutionary Force + Speaker**:
- Divine speaker → More Performative (creative speech)
- Prophet → More Performative (oracular)
- Teacher → More Declarative + Imperative
- Narrative voice → More Declarative

## Languages Requiring Explicit Speech Act Marking

### High-Marking Languages
Languages that *require* explicit particles or morphology for illocutionary force:

**East Asian Language Families:**
- **Mandarin Chinese**: Extensive particle system (ma, ba, le, ne, a, o, ya, la)
- **Japanese**: Particles (ka, na, yo, ne, yo, zo, etc.) mark interrogative, emphatic, assertive, softening
- **Korean**: Particle system marking questions, commands, and various speech levels
- **Cantonese**: Extensive particles (lo, le, ge, wo, me, lak, etc.)
- **Thai**: Particles mark questions and politeness levels
- **Vietnamese**: Particles for interrogative and emphatic marking

**Polynesian Languages:**
- **Māori**: Particle e for imperative, future, subject marking
- **Samoan**: Multiple particles for tense, mood, aspect, and force
- **Hawaiian**: Particles for various grammatical functions

**Austronesian Languages:**
- **Tagalog**: ba for yes-no questions, -ang marking for focus/topics
- **Indonesian**: Particles for questions (ya, kah) and other pragmatic functions
- **Malay**: Similar question particles and emphatic marking
- **Javanese**: Extensive honorific and politeness particle system

**Other Families:**
- **Swahili**: Word order changes and particles for questions
- **Russian**: Particles (ли li, же zhe) for various pragmatic effects
- **Hebrew**: Particles (הֲ ha, אִם im, נָּא na) for interrogative and imperative softening
- **Quechuan**: Suffixes marking hortative, optative, and other moods

### Low-Marking Languages
Languages that primarily rely on word order, intonation, and context:

- **English**: Primarily intonation and word order (inversion for questions)
- **German**: Similar to English with some special forms
- **French**: Somewhat dependent on particles and intonation
- **Spanish**: Primarily intonation; some particles in informal register

---

## Cross-Linguistic Patterns and Implications for Bible Translation

### Pattern 1: Particle Systems vs. Inflectional Systems

**Particle-Based (East Asian, Polynesian):**
- Speech act marking at clause boundary
- Multiple particles can combine for nuanced force
- Particularly clear marking of questions
- *Translation implication*: Greek/Hebrew must be analyzed for implied particles

**Inflectional (German, Russian, Spanish):**
- Mood encoded in verb morphology
- Limited to few major categories
- Less explicit than particle systems
- *Translation implication*: Verb form choice affects force marking

### Pattern 2: Question Marking Complexity

**Unified Question Marking:**
- Some languages mark yes/no and wh- questions identically (Japanese, Mandarin)
- English distinguishes through inversion
- *Translation implication*: Determine if Greek/Hebrew distinguish question types

**Separated Question Types:**
- Some languages have different marking for yes/no vs. wh- questions
- Provides more explicit differentiation
- *Translation implication*: Choose appropriate marker based on question type in source

### Pattern 3: Imperative Register Variation

**High-Variation Languages (Japanese, Korean, Javanese):**
- Dramatically different forms for polite vs. direct commands
- Register choice affects meaning and relationship
- *Translation implication*: Jesus's commands to disciples vs. demons may require different registers

**Low-Variation Languages (English, Spanish):**
- Limited imperative forms beyond basic command
- Register expressed through additional politeness strategies
- *Translation implication*: Politeness achieved through prefaces like "please" rather than verb forms

### Pattern 4: Hortative Expression

**Grammaticalized Hortative:**
- Dedicated morphology (Quechuan -yachun, etc.)
- Distinct from imperative
- *Translation implication*: Proposals distinguished from commands

**Non-Grammaticalized:**
- Expressed through imperative + first-person plural
- Can create ambiguity with command
- *Translation implication*: May require contextual interpretation

### Pattern 5: Exclamative Marking

**Rich Exclamative Systems:**
- Dedicated particles and/or word order patterns
- Spanish ¡Qué...! and similar systems
- *Translation implication*: Rhetorical questions in Hebrew can map onto exclamatives

**Minimal Exclamative Marking:**
- Primarily intonation and context-dependent
- English rarely marks exclamatives grammatically
- *Translation implication*: Context must make emotional force clear

## Critical Bible Translation Issues

### Issue 1: Rhetorical Questions

**The Problem:**
Hebrew and Greek frequently use interrogative forms with declarative/exclamative force. Example: "Can a leopard change its spots?" = No, and you know it.

**Language Challenges:**
- Languages expecting genuine information-seeking questions may misinterpret
- Need marking for "rhetorical" status
- Japanese and Korean have dedicated markers for this

**Solution:**
- Note in TBTA when interrogative form has non-interrogative force
- Provide reasoning for rhetorical interpretation
- Suggest target language forms for rhetorical marking

### Issue 2: Imperative Politeness in Divine Commands

**The Problem:**
Jesus's imperatives (e.g., "Go and sin no more") are commands but not rude in source culture. Many target languages require softening.

**Language Challenges:**
- Japanese distinguishes polite vs. direct imperatives
- Korean requires appropriate speech level
- Some languages mark the relationship between speaker and hearer
- Direct imperative can be offensive to God/Jesus translation

**Solution:**
- Note relationship between command-giver and recipient
- Include register marking in TBTA
- Document expected politeness level for target language

### Issue 3: Hortative vs. Imperative in Corporate Settings

**The Problem:**
"Let us love one another" is a hortative (we together), not an imperative (you must). Confusion affects understanding of community responsibility.

**Language Challenges:**
- Languages without grammaticalized hortative may not distinguish clearly
- Requires first-person plural analysis
- Related to inclusive/exclusive person systems

**Solution:**
- Mark all hortatives explicitly in TBTA
- Note first-person plural inclusion status
- Distinguish from imperative clearly

### Issue 4: Question Types in Dialogue

**The Problem:**
Jesus asks many yes/no questions, some genuinely seeking information, others rhetorical or testing faith.

**Language Challenges:**
- Some languages mark information-seeking vs. rhetorical questions
- Intonation patterns in target language may clarify or obscure
- Question answering conventions differ

**Solution:**
- Categorize each question as genuine or rhetorical
- Note expected response type
- Provide context for information-seeking questions

### Issue 5: Exclamation and Awe

**The Problem:**
Hebrew and Greek use interrogative forms to express awe ("O the depth!"). English often converts to exclamation.

**Language Challenges:**
- Target language may require explicit exclamative marking
- Emotional tone may be lost in unmarked form
- Important for capturing theological emphasis

**Solution:**
- Flag passages with emotional/awe-filled expressions
- Note when interrogative form carries exclamative force
- Suggest exclamative or emphatic marking in target

## Language Family Patterns

### East Asian Languages
**Pattern**: Extensive sentence-final particle systems

**Key Languages**: Mandarin, Japanese, Cantonese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai

**Speech Act Marking:**
- Yes/No questions: Dedicated particles (ma, ka, ni, etc.)
- Wh-questions: Particles optionally added
- Imperatives: Often bare verb with optional politeness particles
- Hortatives: Special forms (Mandarin 让我们)
- Exclamatives: Exclamative particles and intonation

**Bible Translation Implication:**
- Greek/Hebrew must be analyzed for implicit particles
- Particle choice affects reader interpretation significantly
- Register and politeness levels affect theological tone

### Polynesian Languages
**Pattern**: Particle-rich grammatical systems, minimal inflection

**Key Languages**: Hawaiian, Samoan, Māori, Tongan

**Speech Act Marking:**
- Particles encode tense, mood, voice, and aspect
- Questions often formed through particles
- Imperatives frequently use dedicated particles
- Hortatives may be marked

**Bible Translation Implication:**
- Particles are essential for meaning, not optional
- Limited inflectional system requires particle reliance
- Community-oriented hortatives fit cultural communication patterns

### Austronesian Languages (Non-Polynesian)
**Pattern**: Variable particle and inflectional marking

**Key Languages**: Tagalog, Indonesian, Malay, Javanese, Sundanese

**Speech Act Marking:**
- Questions: Particles (ba, kah, ya) common
- Imperatives: Often prefix-marked (mag-, um-, etc.)
- Honorifics: Register marking affects all clause types
- Aspect: Closely linked to mood and force

**Bible Translation Implication:**
- Register choices affect character relationships
- Aspect and tense interact with illocutionary force
- Inclusive/exclusive person systems affect hortatives

### Slavic Languages
**Pattern**: Aspect-based distinction related to mood

**Key Languages**: Russian, Polish, Czech, Ukrainian, Macedonian

**Speech Act Marking:**
- Perfective vs. imperfective aspect relates to force
- Particles (ли li, же zhe) for various effects
- Special forms for wishes and conditionals
- Conditional and subjunctive moods distinct

**Bible Translation Implication:**
- Aspect choice affects force interpretation
- Wishes, commands, and conditions grammaticalized
- Particle use creates pragmatic nuance

### Indigenous American Languages
**Pattern**: Highly diversified systems, often featuring evidentiality and switch-reference

**Key Languages**: Navajo, Quechua, Maya languages, etc.

**Speech Act Marking:**
- Hortatives often grammaticalized (Quechua -yachun)
- Evidentiality marks source of information
- Command vs. suggestion distinctions
- Different marking for direct vs. reported speech

**Bible Translation Implication:**
- Reportative forms affect narrative voice
- Hortative/command distinction available
- Evidentiality marks prophetic vs. narrative speech

## Summary: Why Illocutionary Force Matters for Bible Translation

1. **Speech acts are universal but marking is diverse** - All languages express speech acts; how they do so varies dramatically
2. **Greek/Hebrew use implicit marking** - Source languages often rely on context; target languages may require explicit marking
3. **Register and politeness are inseparable from force** - Marking illocutionary force often requires simultaneous register choice
4. **Rhetorical questions are common in Biblical text** - Distinguishing genuine questions from rhetorical ones is essential
5. **Theological precision depends on force clarity** - Commands, promises, and questions carry theological weight depending on force interpretation
6. **Community-oriented languages prefer hortatives** - Languages with inclusive/exclusive distinctions handle group exhortations better than individual commands
