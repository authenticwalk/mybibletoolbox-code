      - Phase 7 COMPLETE: Validation with limited TBTA data (7/11 adversarial, 3/11 random)
      - Adversarial: 42.9% accuracy (3/7) ✓ within expected range
      - Random: Insufficient data (only 1 independent verse)
      - CRITICAL FINDINGS: (1) Implied superlative recognition failure, (2) Lexical vs syntactic intensification, (3) TBTA uses literal quoted values like '''least''', (4) Structural vs inherent degree distinction, (5) Equative q doesn't exist in TBTA
      - Algorithm failures: 4 major errors reveal semantic complexity issues and data format assumptions
      - Ready for Phase 8: Error analysis and algorithm v2.0
    next_action: "6-step exhaustive debugging, create ERROR-ANALYSIS.md, develop ALGORITHM-v2.md"
    blocked_on: null
    accuracy:
      adversarial_actual: "42.9% (3/7 tested)"
      random_actual: "Insufficient data"

# Notes for workflow improvement
workflow_notes:
  - "Equal value coverage is critical - prevents bias toward common values"
  - "Harder verses in adversarial sets reveal algorithm weaknesses better"
  - "Per-value accuracy metrics more informative than overall accuracy"
  - "6-step exhaustive debugging for every error is essential"
  - "LXX/Vulgate provide authoritative semantic interpretation"
  - "Context pollution prevented by one-phase-per-session approach"

# Blocking issues
blocking_issues:
  - issue: "TBTA data access"
    affects: ["degree", "all future features"]
    status: "in_progress"
    workaround: "Can design training/test sets, make predictions; validation waits for TBTA access"
    notes: "Need method to access TBTA annotations systematically"
