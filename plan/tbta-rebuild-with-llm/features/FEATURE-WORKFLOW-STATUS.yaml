  - "Equal value coverage is critical - prevents bias toward common values"
  - "Harder verses in adversarial sets reveal algorithm weaknesses better"
  - "Per-value accuracy metrics more informative than overall accuracy"
  - "6-step exhaustive debugging for every error is essential"
  - "LXX/Vulgate provide authoritative semantic interpretation"
