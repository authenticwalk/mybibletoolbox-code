# Notes for workflow improvement
workflow_notes:
  - "Equal value coverage is critical - prevents bias toward common values"
  - "Harder verses in adversarial sets reveal algorithm weaknesses better"
  - "Per-value accuracy metrics more informative than overall accuracy"
  - "6-step exhaustive debugging for every error is essential"
  - "LXX/Vulgate provide authoritative semantic interpretation"
  - "Context pollution prevented by one-phase-per-session approach"

# Blocking issues
blocking_issues:
  - issue: "TBTA data access"
    affects: ["degree", "all future features"]
    status: "in_progress"
    workaround: "Can design training/test sets, make predictions; validation waits for TBTA access"
    notes: "Need method to access TBTA annotations systematically"
