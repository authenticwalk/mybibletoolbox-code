# Demonstrative Proximity Systems in TBTA Languages

## Overview

This document explores languages in our TBTA list that contain complex demonstrative proximity systems beyond the basic two-way (near/far) distinction found in English. These include:
- **3-way systems**: Near speaker / Near hearer / Far from both
- **4+ way systems**: Multiple degrees of distance or additional distinctions
- **Visibility/Invisibility distinctions**: Encoding whether referents are visible
- **Elevation-based systems**: Incorporating vertical distance (up/down)

## Key Findings by System Type

### 1. Three-Way Distance-Based Systems (3-Way: Near Speaker / Near Hearer / Far)

These systems distinguish between objects near the speaker, near the listener, and far from both using pure distance/person-oriented distinctions.

**Characteristics:**
- Person-oriented: encode both speaker and hearer spatial positions
- Distance-oriented: encode relative distance from deictic center
- Most common complex demonstrative type cross-linguistically

**TBTA Language Families with 3-way systems:**

#### Austronesian Family
- **Malagasy** (Madagascar): Special case - reportedly has 7-degree system (see Complex Systems below)
- **General Austronesian**: Many languages have proximal, medial, distal systems
- **Source**: WALS Chapter 41 shows 37.6% of mapped languages have three-way contrasts

#### Indo-European Family
- **Spanish**: Este (near speaker) / Ese (near hearer) / Aquel (far from both)
- **English**: Limited to 2-way (this/that), but historically had 3-way in earlier forms
- **Italian, Portuguese, French**: Develop 3-way systems in formal registers

#### Sino-Tibetan Family
- **Tibetan (Lhasa)**: ཕ་གི་ (proximal) / ཕོ་གི་ (medial) / དེ་ (distal)
  - Distance-oriented (based on spatial distance from speaker)
  - Three-way distinction based on relative distance

#### Dravidian Family
- **Tamil, Telugu, Kannada**: Preserve or develop 3-way distance-based systems
  - Near: *i- prefix
  - Middle: *u- prefix
  - Far: *a- prefix
  - Example from Kota: avn (far) / ūn (middle) / ivn (near)
- **Source**: Dravidian languages show systematic distance-based distinctions inherited from Proto-Dravidian

#### Japonic Family
- **Japanese**: Ko-so-a series (こ-そ-あ)
  - Kore/kono: Near speaker (distance-based, but pragmatic consideration of addressee)
  - Sore/sono: Neutral/addressee-proximal
  - Are/ano: Distal/far from both
  - **Classification debate**: Distance-oriented vs. person-oriented (research shows mixed results)
  - **Source**: Anderson & Keenan (1985) classify as distance-based; some behavioral research suggests pragmatic person-orientation

#### Mayan Family
- **Yucatec Maya**: Complex system with egocentric and sociocentric demonstratives
  - Goes beyond simple distance to incorporate social relationships
  - Distinguishes modes of access to referents (direct perception vs. discourse context)
- **Mopan Maya**: Encodes visibility status ("out of sight, out of mind" principle)

---

### 2. Four-Way and Five-Way Systems (4+ Distance Degrees)

Languages with four or more distinct demonstrative terms for spatial distinctions.

**Key characteristics:**
- Almost always person-oriented (encode hearer as distinct reference point)
- Rarer cross-linguistically (only ~8% of languages have 4+ terms)
- Often geographically concentrated

**TBTA Language Families with 4+ way systems:**

#### Trans-New Guinea Family
- **Mian**: Incorporates elevation-based directionals
  - 'ut' = up
  - 'daak' = down
  - 'met' = upriver
  - 'tab' = downriver
  - 'wāt' = across (river)
  - 'tām' = away (from river)
- **Multiple TNG languages** (Fore, Lembena, Una): Demonstratives adapted to local topography, frequently referring to elevation
  - These directional systems integrated into demonstrative/locative grammar
  - Reflect the mountainous terrain and river systems of New Guinea
- **Source**: Demonstratives in TNG languages are "typically adapted to the local topography, frequently referring to elevation"

#### Eskimo-Aleut Family
- **Chevak Cup'ik (Yupik language)**: Exceptionally complex 29-way system
  - Distinctions based on placement in 3D field around interlocutors
  - Includes visibility (visible/invisible) distinction
  - Includes motion status (moving/stationary)
  - **Source**: WALS cross-linguistic typology
  - Related languages in Yupik branch likely have similarly sophisticated systems

#### Kra-Dai Family (Tai languages)
- Likely candidates based on geographic proximity to Trans-New Guinea languages and demonstrated spatial deixis complexity
- May have elevation-based or river-based distinctions similar to Austronesian languages of Southeast Asia

### 3. Visibility/Invisibility Distinction Systems

Languages that grammaticalize whether referents are visible or invisible to the speaker.

**Key characteristics:**
- Less common than distance-based systems alone
- Often co-occurs with distance distinctions
- Vision-specific (not evidence-related like some languages' evidentials)

**TBTA Language Families with visibility distinctions:**

#### Witotoan Family
- **Ticuna**: Four demonstratives with visibility encoding
  - Speaker-proximal: can index visible OR invisible referents
  - Speaker-medial: primarily visible referents
  - Speaker-distal: primarily visible referents
  - Addressee-proximal: can index visible OR invisible referents
  - **Invisible deictic**: Can index any referent the speaker doesn't see, regardless of location
  - **Source**: Skilton (2023) and Cambridge Journal of Child Language research
  - **Visibility feature**: Two demonstratives grammatically encode visibility, one encodes invisibility
  - **Note**: Experimental studies show that while visibility is grammatically encoded, actual usage is influenced by addressee location and referent distance

#### Austronesian Family
- **Malagasy**: Seven-degree system explicitly includes visibility dimension
  - Visible forms: itỳ, ìto, ìo, ìtsy, ìny, iròa, irỳ (seven levels)
  - Non-visible forms: separate paradigm for invisible/non-visible referents
  - Visibility encoding: evidential dimension (visible vs. non-visible referents)
  - Boundedness feature: also encodes whether space is enclosed or open
  - **Source**: Adelaar & Himmelmann typological studies

#### Salish Family (Northwest Coast Native American)
- **Nuxalk (Bella Coola)**: Six deictic determiners
  - Three visible forms: visible proximal, visible medial, visible distal
  - Three invisible forms: invisible proximal, invisible medial, invisible distal
  - **Source**: Davis & Saunders in WALS typology

#### Other potential languages:
- **West Greenlandic**: Demonstrative form *inna* for invisible/out-of-sight entities
- **Quileute, Ute, Warao**: May have demonstrative forms for invisible/obscured referents

### 4. Elevation-Based and Topographic Systems

Languages where demonstratives encode vertical distance (up/down) or other geographic features (upriver/downriver).

**Key characteristics:**
- Typically found in mountainous or river-based environments
- Often integrated with spatial directionals
- Can co-occur with distance and visibility distinctions

**TBTA Language Families with elevation systems:**

#### Trans-New Guinea Family (Primary system type)
- **Mian, Fore, Lembena, Una**: Elevation-based directionals
  - Uphill/downhill distinctions
  - River-based directionals (upriver, downriver, across)
  - Integrated into verbal and nominal morphology
- **Geographic motivation**: New Guinea's extreme topography (many areas with elevation > 3000m and river gorges)
- **Grammatical integration**: Directionals often incorporated into verbs ("incorporated into the verb")

#### Austronesian Family
- **Indonesian/Malaysian languages of New Guinea region**: May show similar topographic adaptation
  - Geographic proximity to TNG languages
  - Similar mountainous terrain

#### Quechuan Family (South America)
- **Quechua languages**: Likely have elevation-based demonstratives
  - Spoken in Andes mountains
  - Geographic motivation similar to TNG

## Typological Insights for Bible Translation

### Implications for Biblical Demonstratives

1. **Three-way systems are common** among languages in our corpus (Dravidian, Sino-Tibetan, Austronesian, Indo-European, Japonic, Mayan)
   - Biblical texts often use demonstratives for discourse deixis and cohesion
   - Person-oriented systems (Spanish, Mayan) may require different translation strategies than distance-oriented systems (Japanese, Tibetan)
   - Hearer-proximal forms may be preferred for interactive/dialogical passages

2. **Elevation matters in many regions**
   - Trans-New Guinea languages use elevation-based directionals
   - Quechuan languages (Andes) likely similar
   - Biblical references to "above" (heaven), "below" (Hades, underworld) may map naturally onto these systems

3. **Visibility is linguistically distinct in some languages**
   - Ticuna, Malagasy, and Nuxalk grammaticalize visible/invisible distinction
   - Biblical references to invisible spiritual entities (angels, demons, God) may require specific demonstrative forms
   - "Unseen" and "seen" dimensions of faith (Hebrews 11:1) could leverage these grammatical resources

4. **Sociocentric (hearer-inclusive) systems exist** in Mayan and possibly others
   - May reflect communal rather than individual perspectives
   - Could affect how demonstratives function in corporate prayer, congregation-addressed teaching
