# Switch-Reference in Bible Translation Languages

## Translation Impact ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (CRITICAL)

**Impact Level**: CRITICAL - Nearly UNIVERSAL in Trans-New Guinea (141 languages), common in Native American languages

**Why This Matters**:
- **Participant Tracking**: "He came and sat down" - same subject requires explicit marking
- **Discourse Coherence**: Clause chains require switch-reference throughout
- **Narrative Structure**: Main clause vs. dependent clause distinction obligatory
- **Translation Complexity**: Greek/Hebrew coordination must restructure to medial/final verb patterns

**Criticality**: HIGHEST - Affects discourse structure of all narrative texts

---

## Executive Summary

Switch-reference is a grammatical system marking whether the subject of one clause is the **same as** or **different from** the subject of an adjacent clause. Languages with switch-reference use special verbal morphology (medial verbs) to track participants across clause chains.

Biblical source languages use coordination and subordination without explicit switch-reference marking. Translators must track subjects and mark continuity/change.

## Complete Value Enumeration

### Core Switch-Reference Categories

1. **Same Subject (SS)** - Continuing subject across clauses
   - Marker: Subject of current clause = subject of next clause
   - Example: "He₁ came and he₁ sat down" → SS marker on "came"

2. **Different Subject (DS)** - Subject change across clauses
   - Marker: Subject of current clause ≠ subject of next clause
   - Example: "He₁ came and she₂ sat down" → DS marker on "came"

3. **Same Subject, Different Time (SS+DT)** - Some languages distinguish
   - Subject continues but temporal break
   - Example: "He₁ came. Later he₁ sat down"

4. **Different Subject, Overlap (DS+OV)** - Some languages distinguish
   - Subject changes but actions overlap temporally
   - Example: "While he₁ was coming, she₂ sat down"

### Medial vs. Final Verb Distinction

**Medial Verbs**:
- Appear in non-final clauses
- Carry switch-reference marking
- Often have reduced TAM (tense-aspect-mood) marking
- Signal more clauses to follow

**Final Verbs**:
- Appear in clause-final position
- Carry full TAM marking
- No switch-reference (end of chain)
- Signal end of clause chain

## Languages with Switch-Reference

### Trans-New Guinea (141 languages) - NEARLY UNIVERSAL

**Pervasive throughout family**:
- Clause chaining fundamental to discourse structure
- Medial verbs obligatory in multi-clause sequences
- Final verb ends clause chain

**Characteristics**:
- Most languages: 2-way system (SS vs. DS)
- Some languages: 3-4 way systems with temporal/aspectual distinctions
- Switch-reference integrates with: aspect, tense, evidentiality, person marking

**See**: [../../languages/families/trans-new-guinea/translation-guide.md](../../languages/families/trans-new-guinea/translation-guide.md)

**Specific mention**:
- Clause chaining and switch-reference listed as #1 high-priority feature
- Essential for maintaining participant tracking
- Requires restructuring Greek/Hebrew coordinated clauses

### Native American Languages

**Families with switch-reference**:
- **Uto-Aztecan**: Common across family
- **Kiowa-Tanoan**: Switch-reference systems
- **Mayan**: Some languages have switch-reference-like systems
- **Various others**: Widespread feature

### Other Families

**Some Papuan languages** outside Trans-New Guinea
**Some Australian languages**: Related tracking systems
**Tucanoan** (Amazon): Switch-reference systems

## Biblical Translation Implications

### Critical Decision Points

#### 1. Gospel Narratives - Sequential Actions

**Mark 1:40-41** - "A leper came to him and begged... Jesus reached out and touched"
- **Subject analysis**:
  - "leper came" (subject: leper)
  - "leper begged" (subject: leper) → **SS** marker
  - "Jesus reached out" (subject: Jesus) → **DS** marker
  - "Jesus touched" (subject: Jesus) → **SS** marker

**Translation structure** (schematic):
```
Leper came-DS (different subject coming)
[Leper] begged-DS (subject changes to Jesus)
Jesus reached.out-SS (same subject continues)
[Jesus] touched-FINAL (end of clause chain)
```

#### 2. Discourse Complexwith Multiple Participants

**John 18:3-6** - "Judas came... Jesus went out and said... they drew back"
- Complex participant tracking
- Multiple subject changes
- Requires careful DS/SS marking throughout

**Challenges**:
- Greek uses coordination (καί)
- Trans-New Guinea requires medial/final verb structure
- Must track: Judas → Jesus → crowd → Jesus → they

#### 3. Same Subject, Long Chains

**Luke 5:4-5** - "Jesus said... Simon answered... he let down... they caught... they signaled..."
- Long clause chains with subject changes
- Each verb requires SS or DS marking
- Final verb at end of pericope

#### 4. Subordinate Clauses vs. Medial Verbs

**Greek subordination** (ὅτι, ἵνα, ὅταν clauses):
- May map to medial verbs with switch-reference
- Or separate clause chains
- Language-specific mapping required

**Example - Matthew 5:3** - "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom"
- "Blessed are" = main clause
- "for theirs is" = reason clause
- Subject change: poor (implied) → kingdom (belongs to them)
- May require DS marking if restructured to medial/final

## Translation Decision Framework

### Step 1: Identify All Subjects in Sequence

**For each clause**:
1. Identify grammatical subject (overt or implied)
2. Track subject across clause boundaries
3. Note subject continuity or change

### Step 2: Determine Clause Chain Structure

**Questions**:
- Which clauses form a coherent chain?
- Where does the clause chain end (final verb position)?
- Are there embedded clause chains (nested structures)?

### Step 3: Mark Switch-Reference

**Decision tree**:
- Subject of clause N = subject of clause N+1 → **SS** marker
- Subject of clause N ≠ subject of clause N+1 → **DS** marker
- Clause N is final in chain → **FINAL** verb (no SR marker)

### Step 4: Handle Temporal/Aspectual Overlaps

**If language distinguishes**:
- Sequential actions → basic SS/DS
- Simultaneous actions → special overlap marker
- Temporal break → different-time marker

---

## Common Prediction Errors

**Error 1**: Missing implicit subject changes
- **Problem**: "He came and sat down" - assuming SS, but Greek may imply different subject
- **Solution**: Consult discourse context; Greek flexibility vs. SR language explicitness

**Error 2**: Coordinated verbs ≠ same subject always
- **Problem**: καί (and) can join clauses with different subjects
- **Solution**: Identify each subject explicitly before assigning SR

**Error 3**: Embedded clauses disrupt chain
- **Problem**: "He came [when she left] and sat" - embedded clause interrupts
- **Solution**: Distinguish main clause chain from embedded clauses

**Error 4**: Final verb misplacement
- **Problem**: Marking medial verb as final too early
- **Solution**: Identify true end of pericope/clause chain

## Language-Specific Patterns

### Trans-New Guinea Clause Chaining

**Typical structure**:
```
Medial-verb-SS + Medial-verb-DS + Medial-verb-SS + Final-verb
```

**TAM marking**:
- Medial verbs: Reduced TAM (often just aspect + SR)
- Final verb: Full TAM (tense, aspect, mood, evidentiality)

**Person marking**:
- Medial verbs: May have reduced person marking
- Final verb: Full person/number agreement

**Example structure (schematic)**:
```
Jesus went-MEDIAL-SS (same subject continuing)
[Jesus] saw-MEDIAL-DS (different subject coming)
Disciples came-MEDIAL-SS (same subject continuing)
[Disciples] asked-FINAL (end of chain, full TAM)
```

### Native American Languages

**Variation**:
- Some languages: More elaborate SR systems (3-4 distinctions)
- Temporal overlap markers common
- Integration with other categories (obviation, topic)

## Interaction with Other Features

### 1. Participant Tracking

Switch-reference IS a form of participant tracking:
- SR explicitly marks subject continuity
- Complements participant tracking annotations
- Critical for pro-drop languages within SR systems

### 2. Evidentiality

In Trans-New Guinea languages with both:
- Medial verbs: Often no evidential marking
- Final verbs: Carry evidential + full TAM
- SR and evidentiality distributed complementarily

### 3. Aspect Marking

- Medial verbs: Often aspect-marked (perfective/imperfective)
- SR interacts with aspect: simultaneous (imperfective) vs. sequential (perfective)

### 4. Obviation (4th Person)

Some Native American languages have both:
- Obviation: Tracks prominence of 3rd person referents
- Switch-reference: Tracks subject continuity
- Systems interact: obviative subjects require special SR marking

---

## Translation Quality Checkpoints

1. **Subject Tracking**: Is every subject accurately identified across clause chains?
2. **SR Consistency**: Do SS markers appear when subjects continue, DS when they change?
3. **Final Verb Placement**: Is final verb at true end of clause chain?
4. **Medial Verb TAM**: Are medial verbs appropriately reduced in TAM marking?
5. **Discourse Coherence**: Does SR marking match natural discourse flow?

## Restructuring Greek/Hebrew for SR Languages

### Greek Coordination (καί "and")

**Greek**: "Jesus came and sat down and spoke"
- Simple coordination
- Subject implicit

**SR Language** (Trans-New Guinea):
```
Jesus came-MEDIAL-SS
[Jesus] sat.down-MEDIAL-SS
[Jesus] spoke-FINAL
```

### Greek Subordination

**Greek**: "When he came, they went out"
- Temporal subordination
- Subject change explicit

**SR Language**:
```
He came-MEDIAL-DS
They went.out-FINAL
```

Or separate clause chains depending on language structure.

### Complex Sentences

**Greek**: "Jesus, seeing the crowd, had compassion and healed them"
- Participial construction (seeing)
- Main verbs (had compassion, healed)

**SR Language** (possible restructuring):
```
Jesus saw-MEDIAL-SS (seeing = clause 1)
[Jesus] had.compassion-MEDIAL-SS (clause 2)
[Jesus] healed-FINAL (clause 3, end of chain)
```

## Theological Implications

### None Directly

Switch-reference is a **discourse structural feature**, not a semantic one:
- Doesn't change meaning
- Ensures clarity of participant tracking
- May make theological points clearer by explicit subject tracking

### Indirectly

**Participant clarity enhances theology**:
- "He came and saved" - explicit that same subject (Jesus) does both actions
- Avoids ambiguity in complex narratives
- Subject tracking in parables clarified
