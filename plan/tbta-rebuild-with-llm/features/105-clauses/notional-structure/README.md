# Notional Structure in TBTA

## Overview

**Notional Structure** identifies where a clause fits in discourse development—the narrative arc (orientation → climax → resolution), argument structure (assertion → evidence), or instructional flow (goal → steps). This feature works with Discourse Genre and Salience Band to provide a three-dimensional view of information flow.

While Genre tells you *what kind* of text, and Salience tells you *how prominent*, Notional Structure tells you *where you are* in that genre's development.

**Position**: Clause-level (Position 12) | **Values**: 17 total, organized by genre

## Complete Structure List

### Narrative Structures (7)
- **O** - Orientation: Scene-setting, introduces time/place/participants
- **I** - Inciting Incident: Problem that starts the action
- **D** - Developing Conflict: Rising action toward climax
- **C** - Climax: Peak moment, highest tension
- **R** - Resolution: Falling action, tension resolves
- **E** - Exposition: Background info mid-narrative
- **c** - Conclusion: Wrap-up, narrative closure

### Hortatory Structures (2)
- **H** - Exhortation: The command or appeal itself
- **M** - Motivation: Reason supporting the command

### Procedural Structures (3)
- **G** - Goal: Purpose or desired outcome
- **S** - Steps: Sequential instructions
- **s** - Summary: Recap of procedure

### Persuasive Structures (2)
- **A** - Assertion: Claim or thesis being argued
- **a** - Argument: Evidence or reasoning supporting claim

### Expository Structures (3)
- **T** - Topic: Main topic introduction
- **i** - Information: Details elaborating the topic
- **t** - Topic Shift: Transition to new/contrasting topic

## The Three-Layer Discourse System

TBTA provides three complementary perspectives:
1. **Genre (Pos 11)**: *What kind?* (Narrative, Hortatory, Expository)
2. **Notional Structure (Pos 12)**: *Where in development?* (Orientation, Climax, Resolution)
3. **Salience Band (Pos 13)**: *How prominent?* (Pivotal, Primary, Background)

### Example: Genesis Flood Narrative (Genre: Narrative)

| Passage | Structure | Salience | Translation Impact |
|---------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Gen 6:5-8 | O (Orientation) | s (Setting) | Background tenses, scene-setting |
| Gen 6:13 | I (Incident) | P (Pivotal) | Transition markers, heightened emphasis |
| Gen 7:11-16 | C (Climax) | P (Pivotal) | **Peak marking, maximum emphasis** |
| Gen 8:1-5 | R (Resolution) | 1 (Primary) | Result markers, moderating prominence |
| Gen 8:20-22 | c (Conclusion) | P (Pivotal) | Conclusive particles, thematic weight |

## Translation Impact by Structure Type

### Narrative: Peak Marking & Tense Selection

**Languages requiring peak marking**: Bantu (special verb forms), Austronesian (peak particles), Chinese (aspect markers)

**Tense/Aspect by Structure**:
- **Orientation (O)**: Background tenses - French imparfait, Swahili -ki-, Tagalog imperfective
- **Developing (D)**: Main narrative - French passé simple, Swahili ka-, Tagalog perfective
- **Climax (C)**: Dramatic/special peak forms - intensifiers, emphatic particles
- **Resolution (R)**: Result-oriented tenses

**Translation Risk**: Without structure data, translators may miss climactic moments requiring special emphasis.

### Hortatory: Command-Motivation Relations

**Structure Pattern**: H (Exhortation) → M (Motivation)

**Language Variations**:
- English: "Do X. For Y."
- Japanese: "Y から X してください" (Because Y, please do X)
- Hebrew/Greek: Imperative + כי/γάρ clause

**Translation Risk**: Merging commands with motivations weakens imperative force.

### Expository: Topic-Prominent Languages

**Structure Pattern**: T (Topic) → i (Information) → t (Topic Shift)

**Topic-Comment Languages** (Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Tagalog):
- **Topic (T)**: Gets topic marker (wa, eun/neun, topic-fronting, ang)
- **Information (i)**: Gets new-information markers (ga, i/ga)
- **Topic Shift (t)**: Requires contrastive particles

**Translation Risk**: Topic structures unmarked = unnatural discourse flow.

### Persuasive: Argument Logic Flow

**Structure Pattern**: A (Assertion) → a (Argument)

**Cross-linguistic Variation**:
- Western: Claim → Evidence
- Some Asian: Evidence → Claim
- Logical connectors vary ("therefore" position)

**Translation Risk**: Argument flow disrupted if structure ignored.

## Language Family Impacts

| Language Type | Impact | Key Features |
|---------------|--------|--------------|
| **Narrative-marking** (Bantu, Austronesian, Native American) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Peak marking obligatory; verb tense/aspect by structure; foreground/background grammaticalized |
| **Topic-prominent** (Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Tagalog) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Topic (T) gets wa/eun; Information (i) gets ga/i; Topic shift (t) needs particles |
| **Honorific/Register** (Japanese, Korean, Javanese, Thai) | ⭐⭐⭐ | Exhortation (H) needs command register; structure affects formality level |
| **Discourse-particle** (East Asian, Pacific) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Structure determines particle selection at clause boundaries |

## Verse Examples with Translation Guidance

### Example 1: Genesis 7:11-16 (Narrative Climax)
```yaml
Structure: C (Climax) | Salience: P (Pivotal) | Genre: Narrative

Translation Guidance:
- Peak marking particles (if available in target language)
- Foreground/dramatic verb tense
- Maximum emphasis/intensifiers
- Temporal precision important ("in the six hundredth year...")
```

### Example 2: Ephesians 6:10-13 (Hortatory Pattern)
```yaml
v10: Structure: H (Exhortation) | "Be strong in the Lord"
v11-13: Structure: M (Motivation) | "For our struggle is not..."

Translation Guidance:
- Strong imperative for H (command register)
- Subordinate/explanatory connectors for M ("for," "because")
- Different salience levels (H=Primary, M=Secondary)
```

### Example 3: Romans 1:16-17 (Expository Topic)
```yaml
Structure: T (Topic) | "Gospel is power of God"

Translation Guidance:
- Topic markers (Japanese wa, Korean eun)
- Emphatic positioning
- High salience marking
- Sets up subsequent information (i) clauses
```

### Example 4: Romans 3:21 (Expository Topic Shift)
```yaml
Structure: t (Topic Shift) | "But now..."

Translation Guidance:
- Contrastive particles ("but," "however")
- Paragraph/section boundary
- Signals major transition in argument
```

## Validation Requirements

**Critical (Must Pass)**:
1. Structure matches genre (Narrative structures only in narratives, etc.)
2. Sequential logic preserved (Orientation before Climax, Assertion before Argument)
3. Aligns with salience (Climax=high, Background=low)

**High Priority (80%+)**:
1. All narrative arcs have key structures marked
2. Consistent structure assignments for similar passages
3. Assignments grounded in discourse analysis

---

## Related Features

- **Discourse Genre (Pos 11)**: Determines valid structures
- **Salience Band (Pos 13)**: Structure + salience must align
- **Illocutionary Force (Pos 3)**: Commands common in Exhortation (H)
- **Time/Aspect**: Structures guide tense/aspect selection
- **Location (Pos 15)**: Structures align with discourse boundaries

---

## Summary

**Purpose**: Shows WHERE in discourse development (orientation → climax → resolution; topic → information → shift)

**Translation Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Universal - all languages organize discourse; structure guides grammar choices

**Critical For**:
- Narrative-marking languages: Peak marking obligatory
- Topic-prominent languages: Topic (T) identification essential
- Discourse-particle languages: Structure determines particle selection

**Key Insight**: Notional Structure is the "roadmap" of discourse flow, enabling translators to use appropriate grammatical resources at each stage of text development.
