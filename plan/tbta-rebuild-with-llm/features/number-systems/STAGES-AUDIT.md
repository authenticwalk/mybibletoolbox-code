## Stage Completion Status

### Stage 1: Research TBTA Documentation ✅
**Status**: completed
- Has comprehensive documentation of number systems (singular, dual, trial, plural, etc.)
- Documents theological context (Trinity = trial)
- References TBTA source data

### Stage 2: Language Study ✅
**Status**: completed
- Includes language family analysis (Austronesian, Oceanic, etc.)
- Documents semantic vs morphological encoding
- Provides translation guidance

### Stage 3: Scholarly and Internet Research ✅
**Status**: completed
- Includes linguistic research on number systems
- Documents cross-linguistic patterns

### Stage 4: Generate Proper Test Set ⚠️
**Status**: partial (alternative approach)
- Used adversarial-test/ and random-test/ structure
- ~20 verses per test set (not 100 per value)
- Balanced sampling achieved
- **Gap**: Not in YAML 40/30/30 format

### Stage 5: Propose Hypothesis and First Prompt ✅
**Status**: completed
- Algorithm v1 and v2 exist
- LEARNINGS.md documents iteration
- Error analysis comprehensive
- Achieved high accuracy
- **Gap**: No single ANALYSIS.md with 12 approaches

### Stage 6: Test Against Validate Set ⚠️
**Status**: partial
- Validation results exist
- Peer review conducted
- **Gap**: Unclear if subagents used

## Overall Assessment

**Completion**: 4/6 completed, 2/6 partial
**Status**: mostly-complete
**Complies with STAGES.md**: mostly

## Recommendations

1. Add README.md with stage checklist and methodology note
2. Document that this used 10-phase methodology (explain difference)
3. Preserve existing structure (WORKING WELL)

## Conclusion

**Number Systems is a SOLID implementation** with good accuracy using the 10-phase methodology. Similar to person-systems, it achieves the INTENT of STAGES.md with minor structural differences.

**Status**: ✅ **VALIDATED** - Acceptable with minor documentation updates
