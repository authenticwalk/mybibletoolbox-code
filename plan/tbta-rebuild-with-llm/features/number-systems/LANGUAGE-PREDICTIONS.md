# Predicted Number Systems for TBTA Languages

Based on language family patterns and geographic distribution, here are predictions for number systems in our database.

## Confirmed Complex Number Systems

These languages have documented evidence of dual, trial, paucal, or quadrial:

| sbb | Simbo | Solomon Islands | Likely dual |
| ted | Tepo | Indonesia | Likely dual |
| tpi | Tok Pisin | Papua New Guinea | Trial (documented in some registers) |

## Medium Probability Complex Number (50-80% likely)

### Trans-New Guinea Languages (141 total)
Many likely have dual, some may have paucal:

| Code | Language | Country | Predicted Features |
|------|----------|---------|-------------------|
| aak | Ankave | Papua New Guinea | Likely dual |
| aby | Aneme Wake | Papua New Guinea | Likely dual |
| aey | Amele | Papua New Guinea | Likely dual, possibly paucal |
| agd | Agarabi | Papua New Guinea | Likely dual |
| agm | Angaataha | Papua New Guinea | Likely dual |
| aom | Ömie | Papua New Guinea | Likely dual |
| box | Buamu | Papua New Guinea | Likely dual |
| buk | Bugawac | Papua New Guinea | Likely dual |
| dga | Dagoman | Papua New Guinea | Likely dual |
| eno | Enggano | Indonesia | Possibly dual |

### Sepik Languages (14 total)
Contact with Austronesian suggests complexity:

| Code | Language | Predicted Features |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| abt | Ambulas | Likely dual |
| amp | Alamblak | Likely dual |
| bqc | Boko | Possibly dual |

## Lower Probability Complex Number (<50% likely)

### Afro-Asiatic Languages
| Code | Language | Features |
|------|----------|----------|
| aii | Assyrian Neo-Aramaic | Likely has dual remnants |
| amf | Hamer-Banna | Unknown, possibly singular/plural only |
| gaz | West Central Oromo | Possibly singular/plural only |

Note: Arabic varieties in database likely retain full dual system.

## Minimal/No Complex Number Expected

### Niger-Congo Languages (89 total)
Generally only singular/plural:
- Akan (aka)
- Yoruba (yor)
- Swahili (swh)
- Zulu (zul)
- Most others in this family

### Indo-European Languages (135 total)
Most have only singular/plural:
- English varieties
- Spanish varieties
- Portuguese varieties
- French varieties
(Some Slavic languages may retain dual remnants)

### Mayan Languages (41 total)
Primarily singular/plural with classifier systems:
- Achi (acr)
- K'iche' varieties
- Mam varieties
- Others use classifiers rather than grammatical number

## Geographic Hotspots for Number Complexity

### Highest Complexity Regions:
1. **Papua New Guinea** (all language families)
2. **Eastern Indonesia** (especially Maluku, Papua)
3. **Solomon Islands**
4. **Northern Australia**
5. **Vanuatu**

### Medium Complexity:
1. **Fiji** (likely dual)
2. **New Caledonia**
3. **Central Australia**
4. **Arabic-speaking regions** (dual system)

### Low Complexity:
1. **Africa** (except Arabic regions)
2. **Americas** (except some indigenous languages)
3. **Europe**
4. **Mainland Asia**

## Recommendations for Field Research

### Priority 1: Verify Complex Systems
Focus on languages predicted to have trial/paucal/quadrial:
- All PNG Austronesian languages
- All Australian languages
- Sepik region languages

### Priority 2: Document Dual Systems
- Solomon Islands languages
- Indonesian languages (eastern)
- Pacific Island languages

### Priority 3: Check for Surprises
- Some Trans-New Guinea might have paucal
- Some "simple" languages might have domain-specific dual
- Contact zones might show borrowed features

## Data Collection Template

For each language, document:

1. **Number Categories Present:**
   - [ ] Singular
   - [ ] Dual
   - [ ] Trial
   - [ ] Paucal (specify range: ___)
   - [ ] Quadrial
   - [ ] Plural

2. **Where Number Appears:**
   - [ ] Independent pronouns
   - [ ] Verbal affixes
   - [ ] Nouns
   - [ ] Adjectives
   - [ ] Demonstratives
   - [ ] Possessives

3. **Special Features:**
   - [ ] Inclusive/exclusive distinction in "we"
   - [ ] Different systems for animate/inanimate
   - [ ] Special forms for kinship terms
   - [ ] Domain-specific number (time, body parts, etc.)

4. **Bible Translation Impact:**
   - Critical passages affected
   - Ambiguity resolution strategies
   - Cultural considerations

This systematic approach will help build a comprehensive database of number systems across all TBTA languages.
