**Date**: 2025-11-09
**Algorithm**: v1.0 (from METHODOLOGY-STATUS.md)
**Status**: LOCKED - Predictions made WITHOUT checking TBTA
**Git commit SHA**: [To be added after commit]

## Algorithm v1.0 Summary

Applied patterns from training (experiment-001):

1. **Semantic Over Morphological**: Count entities semantically ("How many X?")
2. **Theological Context**: Trinity contexts = Trial + First Inclusive
3. **Discourse Role**: Same entity, different roles = different numbers
4. **Fossilized Forms**: shamayim, mayim → always Singular
5. **Ancient Translations**: LXX/Vulgate for ambiguous cases

## Predictions

### 1. Romans 1:16 - "The Gospel" (τὸ εὐαγγέλιον)

**Verse**: "For I am not ashamed of the gospel"
**Constituent**: τὸ εὐαγγέλιον (to euangelion) "the gospel"

**Morphology**: Neuter singular with singular article
**Semantics**: One gospel message

**Algorithm application**:
- Clear singular morphology and semantics align
- Pattern 1: Semantic count = 1
- No ambiguity

**Prediction**: **Singular**
**Confidence**: High

---

### 2. Psalm 23:1 - "The LORD" / "My Shepherd" (יְהוָה רֹעִי)

**Verse**: "The LORD is my shepherd"
**Constituents**:
- יְהוָה (YHWH) "the LORD"
- רֹעִי (roi) "my shepherd"

**Morphology**: Both singular
**Semantics**: One God, one shepherd

**Algorithm application**:
- Pattern 1: Semantic matches morphological
- Clear singular for both constituents
- No ambiguity

**Prediction**: **Singular** (both constituents)
**Confidence**: High

---

### 3. Genesis 1:27 - "Male and Female" / "Them" (אֹתָם)

**Verse**: "Male and female he created them"
**Constituent**: אֹתָם (otam) "them"

**Morphology**: Dual/plural suffix
**Semantics**: Two persons (Adam and Eve, male + female)

**Algorithm application**:
- Pattern 1: Semantic count = 2
- Context establishes exactly two persons
- Natural pair

**Prediction**: **Dual**
**Confidence**: High

---

### 4. Ruth 1:8 - "Each of You" (אִשָּׁה)

**Verse**: "Go, return each of you to her mother's house"
**Constituent**: אִשָּׁה (ishah) "each"

**Morphology**: Distributive singular
**Semantics**: Distributive over two women (Orpah and Ruth)

**Algorithm application**:
- Pattern 1: Semantic consideration
- "Each" = distributive singular form
- But context = two daughters-in-law (dual group)
- Question: Mark the distributive form or the underlying group?
- Training didn't cover distributive constructions

**Prediction**: **Dual**
**Confidence**: Medium
**Reasoning**: Context establishes dual group, "each" distributes over two
**Alternative**: Singular (distributive form itself)

---

### 5. Genesis 18:2 - "Three Men" (שְׁלֹשָׁה אֲנָשִׁים)

**Verse**: "And behold, three men were standing in front of him"
**Constituent**: שְׁלֹשָׁה (shloshah) "three"

**Morphology**: Explicit numeral "three" + plural noun
**Semantics**: Three persons (often interpreted as divine visitation, but not explicit Trinity)

**Algorithm application**:
- Pattern 2: Trinity = Trial
- Question: Does Trial extend to all explicit "three" or only Trinity?
- Training focused on Gen 1:26 Trinity pronoun
- This is NOT explicit Trinity reference (three men/visitors)
- Consistent with adversarial prediction for 1 John 5:7-8

**Prediction**: **Plural**
**Confidence**: Low
**Reasoning**: Trial likely reserved for explicit Trinity theological contexts
**Alternative**: Trial (if all explicit "three" groups get Trial)

---

### 6. Genesis 1:26 - "Let Us Make" (נַעֲשֶׂה)

**Verse**: "Let us make man in our image"
**Constituent**: Implicit subject of נַעֲשֶׂה (naaseh) "let us make"

**Morphology**: First person plural cohortative
**Semantics**: Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit)

**Algorithm application**:
- Pattern 2: Trinity = Trial + First Inclusive
- THIS WAS IN TRAINING SET (control verse)
- Training established this as clearest Trinity example

**Prediction**: **Trial** + **First Inclusive**
**Confidence**: High (from training)
**Note**: This is a control verse to verify algorithm consistency

---

### 7. Daniel 7:3 - "Four Great Beasts" (אַרְבַּע חֵיוָן)

**Verse**: "And four great beasts came up out of the sea"
**Constituent**: אַרְבַּע (arba) "four"

**Morphology**: Explicit numeral "four"
**Semantics**: Four distinct apocalyptic beasts

**Algorithm application**:
- No training on Quadrial
- Question: Does Quadrial exist in TBTA?
- Similar to adversarial Rev 4:6, Ezek 1:5
- No evidence from training

**Prediction**: **Plural**
**Confidence**: Low
**Alternative**: Paucal (small group) or Quadrial (if exists)

---

### 8. John 11:17 - "Four Days" (τέσσαρας ἡμέρας)

**Verse**: "He had already been in the tomb four days"
**Constituent**: τέσσαρας (tessaras) "four"

**Morphology**: Accusative numeral "four" + plural "days"
**Semantics**: Four time units (non-theological context)

**Algorithm application**:
- Same reasoning as Dan 7:3
- No training on Quadrial
- Non-theological context (just time measurement)

**Prediction**: **Plural**
**Confidence**: Low
**Alternative**: Paucal or Quadrial

---

### 9. Genesis 7:13 - "Eight Persons" (Noah's Family)

**Verse**: References to Noah, his wife, his three sons, and their wives entering ark
**Context**: Exactly 8 people

**Morphology**: Small specific number (8)
**Semantics**: Bounded group of 8 individuals

**Algorithm application**:
- No training on Paucal
- Question: Paucal range typically 3-10 or 3-15
- 8 falls within typical paucal range
- But no training evidence

**Prediction**: **Plural**
**Confidence**: Medium-Low
**Reasoning**: Safe default without paucal training
**Alternative**: Paucal (if 8 within TBTA's paucal range)

---

### 10. Matthew 10:1 - "Twelve Disciples" (δώδεκα μαθητάς)

**Verse**: "His twelve disciples"
**Constituent**: δώδεκα (dōdeka) "twelve"

**Morphology**: Explicit numeral "twelve" + plural noun
**Semantics**: Small bounded group (the Twelve)

**Algorithm application**:
- No training on Paucal
- Question: Paucal upper boundary
- 12 is boundary case (might be paucal ≤12 or plural >10)
- Specific well-known group

**Prediction**: **Plural**
**Confidence**: Medium-Low
**Reasoning**: Boundary case, safer to default to plural
**Alternative**: Paucal (if ≤12 or ≤15)

---

### 11. Ephesians 6:1 - "Children" / "Parents" (τὰ τέκνα / τοῖς γονεῦσιν)

**Verse**: "Children, obey your parents"
**Constituents**:
- τὰ τέκνα (ta tekna) "children"
- τοῖς γονεῦσιν (tois goneusin) "parents"

**Morphology**: Both clear plural (article + noun)
**Semantics**: Multiple children, multiple parents

**Algorithm application**:
- Clear plural morphology and semantics
- No ambiguity

**Prediction**: **Plural** (both constituents)
**Confidence**: High

---

### 12. Psalm 103:20 - "You His Angels" (מַלְאָכָיו)

**Verse**: "Bless the LORD, O you his angels"
**Constituent**: מַלְאָכָיו (mal'akhav) "his angels"

**Morphology**: Plural noun + third masculine singular suffix
**Semantics**: Many angels

**Algorithm application**:
- Clear plural morphology
- Semantically many beings
- No ambiguity

**Prediction**: **Plural**
**Confidence**: High

## Confidence Distribution

- **High confidence** (7 predictions): Rom 1:16, Ps 23:1, Gen 1:27, Gen 1:26†, Eph 6:1, Ps 103:20
- **Medium confidence** (1 prediction): Ruth 1:8
- **Medium-Low confidence** (2 predictions): Gen 7:13, Matt 10:1
- **Low confidence** (2 predictions): Gen 18:2, Dan 7:3, John 11:17

---

## Expected Accuracy

**Target**: 80-90% (10-11 correct out of 12)

**High confidence predictions** (7 verses): Should all be correct = 7/7
- Includes Gen 1:26 control from training

**Medium+ confidence** (3 verses): Expect 2-3 correct
- Ruth 1:8: Dual vs. Singular (distributive)
- Gen 7:13: Plural vs. Paucal (8 persons)
- Matt 10:1: Plural vs. Paucal (12 disciples)

**Low confidence** (3 verses): Expect 1-2 correct
- Gen 18:2: Plural vs. Trial (three men)
- Dan 7:3, John 11:17: Plural vs. Paucal/Quadrial (four)

**Overall expected**: 10-11 correct = 83-92% ✅

---

## Comparison with Adversarial

**Random test characteristics**:
- Clearer morphology-semantics alignment
- Less theological ambiguity
- More straightforward cases
- Includes 1 control from training

**Expected gap**: Random 80-90% vs. Adversarial 60-70% = 15-25 points ✅

---

## Key Uncertainties

1. **Rare values**: Trial for non-Trinity "three"? Quadrial existence? Paucal boundary?
2. **Distributive constructions**: Ruth 1:8 "each" over dual group
3. **Small number boundary**: Where does paucal end (8? 10? 12? 15?)

These uncertainties are LESS ambiguous than adversarial set, but still present.
