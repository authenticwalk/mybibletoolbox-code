---

## Critical Patterns Discovered

### Pattern 1: 'less' vs Comparative

- **'less'**: Progressive decrease, no explicit comparison (GEN 8:1-5)
- **Comparative**: Explicit comparison "X is less than Y"

### Pattern 2: E (Extremely Intensified) Triggers

- Extreme emotional states (sad, hungry, angry)
- Pre-flood wickedness
- Hyperbolic contexts
- Often with dramatic narrative emphasis

### Pattern 3: i (Intensified Comparative) Triggers

- Numerical intensifiers (7x, 10x)
- Emphatic comparisons
- Hebrew constructions with multiple intensifiers
- "Too great for..." constructions (2SAM 7:19)

### Pattern 4: 'too' vs Comparative

- **'too'**: Beyond capacity/ability (too old to bear children)
- **Comparative**: Relative degree (older than sister)

### Pattern 5: Mixed Degree Annotations

- GEN 18:11: "old" marked BOTH Intensified and 'too'
- GEN 6:11: "evil" (E) + "violent" (I)
- EST 1:5: Multiple 'least' and Superlative annotations

**Insight**: Same word can have multiple degree annotations in same verse!

---

## Hebrew vs Greek Patterns

### Hebrew Patterns

**מִן constructions**:
- Can be Comparative: GEN 7:20
- Can be 'too': GEN 4:13
- Can be 'less': GEN 8:1-5

**Context determines meaning!**

**Progressive descriptions**:
- Flood rising: Comparative
- Flood receding: 'less'

### Greek Patterns (in context)

(Limited Greek in this batch, mostly Genesis/OT)

## Value Inventory COMPLETE ✅

After 71 verses tested, we have found ALL documented values:

| Category | Values | Status |

| **Rare intensified** | i, E | ✅ Both found |
| **Rare diminished** | L | ✅ Found |
| **Rare excessive** | T | ✅ Found |
| **Literal values** | 'least', 'less', 'too', others? | ✅ All three found |
| **Non-existent** | q, s | ❌ Confirmed absent |

## Algorithm v2.0 Performance (Estimated)

**Not yet tested on batch 3**, but expected challenges:

1. **'less' value**: v2.0 doesn't know this exists → Will fail GEN 8:1-5
2. **E value**: v2.0 doesn't know this exists → Will fail 6 verses
3. **Hebrew מִן ambiguity**: Needs context to distinguish C vs T vs L
4. **Mixed annotations**: Needs to handle multiple degrees on same word
5. **Progressive decrease**: Different from comparison

**Estimated accuracy**: 40-50% (many new values unknown to v2.0)

---

## Key Insights for Algorithm v2.1+

### Fix 1: Add L, E values to inventory

**'less' (L)** triggers:
- Progressive decrease contexts
- No explicit comparison marker
- Hebrew: Waters "going down" not "less than X"

**Extremely Intensified (E)** triggers:
- Extreme emotional states
- Hyperbolic contexts
- Narrative emphasis on maximum degree
- Often in dramatic situations

### Fix 2: Hebrew מִן disambiguation

Needs context analysis:
1. Rising/increasing → Comparative
2. Excessive/inability → 'too'
3. Decreasing/receding → 'less'

### Fix 3: Support mixed annotations

Same constituent can have multiple degrees:
- GEN 18:11: "old" = Intensified + 'too'
- Handle multiple degree markers on same word

### Fix 4: Literal value encoding flexibility

Found patterns:
- '''least''' (triple quotes) - MAT 5:19
- 'least' (single quotes) - JDG 6:15, 1SAM 9:21, EST 1:5
- 'less' (single quotes) - GEN 8:1-5
- 'too' (single quotes) - GEN 4:13+

Parser must handle both.
