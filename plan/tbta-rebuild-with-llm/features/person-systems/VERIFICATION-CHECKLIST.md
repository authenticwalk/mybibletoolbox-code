## Improvements Made

1. **Added explicit star ratings** to Translation Impact section (TIER 1.1)
2. **Created Complete Value Enumeration table** with all values, definitions, examples (TIER 1.2)
3. **Added Common Errors section** in systematic table format (TIER 2.8)
4. **Maintained line count compliance** through condensation (200 lines exactly)
5. **Verified all elements** present across documentation suite

No restructuring needed - existing content was already very good, just needed formalization and star ratings.
