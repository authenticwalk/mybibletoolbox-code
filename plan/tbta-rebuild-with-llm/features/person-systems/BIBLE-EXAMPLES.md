# Real Bible Translation Examples: Person System Challenges

## John 17:21 - Unity Prayer

### The Translation Challenge

Jesus prays for unity among believers, using pronouns that must be disambiguated in clusivity languages.

### Original Greek
"ἵνα πάντες ἓν ὦσιν, καθὼς σύ, πάτερ, ἐν ἐμοὶ κἀγὼ ἐν σοί, ἵνα καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐν ἡμῖν ὦσιν"
- ἡμῖν (hēmin) = "us" (no inclusive/exclusive distinction in Greek)

### Translations Requiring Clusivity Decisions

#### Indonesian (Alkitab Terjemahan Baru)
"supaya mereka semua menjadi satu, sama seperti Engkau, ya Bapa, di dalam Aku dan Aku di dalam Engkau, agar mereka juga di dalam **Kita**"

**Analysis:** Uses "Kita" (inclusive we/us), indicating believers are included in the divine unity. This is a theological interpretation that the unity extends to include believers within the Father-Son relationship.

#### Tagalog (Ang Dating Biblia 1905)
"na sila nama'y suma **atin**"
(that they also may be in **us**)

**Analysis:** Uses "atin" (inclusive form), similarly interpreting that believers are included in the divine "us."

### Theological Impact

The choice of inclusive "Kita/atin" suggests:
- Believers are invited into the divine relationship
- The prayer emphasizes incorporation, not just imitation
- The unity is participatory, not merely observational

An exclusive form would suggest:
- Believers remain outside the Father-Son relationship
- Unity is modeled after, but separate from, divine unity
- More hierarchical distinction

## 1 Corinthians 1:23 - "We Preach Christ Crucified"

### Original Greek
"ἡμεῖς δὲ κηρύσσομεν Χριστὸν ἐσταυρωμένον"
- ἡμεῖς (hēmeis) = "we" (ambiguous)

### The Question
Does Paul mean:
- "We apostles" (exclusive) - establishing apostolic authority
- "We believers" (inclusive) - including the Corinthian church

### Translation Implications

**Exclusive interpretation:**
- Emphasizes apostolic authority and unique calling
- Distinguishes between those who preach and those who receive
- Creates clearer role boundaries

**Inclusive interpretation:**
- Emphasizes shared gospel mission
- Includes Corinthian believers as fellow proclaimers
- Promotes church unity and participation

## Matthew 6:9 - The Lord's Prayer

### Original Greek
"Πάτερ ἡμῶν ὁ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς"
- ἡμῶν (hēmōn) = "our" (genitive of "we")

### Critical Decision Point
When Jesus teaches the disciples to pray "Our Father," who is included in "our"?

### Options in Clusivity Languages

1. **Exclusive:** "Our Father" (we disciples, not you listeners)
   - Prayer for the inner circle
   - Discipleship marker
   - Special relationship emphasis

2. **Inclusive:** "Our Father" (all of us together)
   - Universal prayer
   - Community emphasis
   - Invitation to relationship

### Real-World Impact
Indonesian and Tagalog translations typically use inclusive forms, reflecting theological decisions about the prayer's universal nature.

## Acts 2:32 - Resurrection Witness

### Original Greek
"τοῦτον τὸν Ἰησοῦν ἀνέστησεν ὁ θεός, οὗ πάντες ἡμεῖς ἐσμεν μάρτυρες"
"This Jesus God raised up, of which we all are witnesses"

### Translation Challenge
Peter speaks to the crowd. Does "we" mean:
- The apostles only (exclusive)
- All believers present (inclusive)

### Historical Context Matters
- If exclusive: Emphasizes apostolic eyewitness authority
- If inclusive: Some in the crowd may have witnessed events

## Romans 5:1 - Justification by Faith

### Original Greek
"Δικαιωθέντες οὖν ἐκ πίστεως εἰρήνην ἔχομεν"
"Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace"

### Clusivity Impact
- **Inclusive:** Paul identifies with Roman believers
- **Exclusive:** Paul speaks of a general Christian experience without directly including his specific audience

### Translation Tendency
Most languages with clusivity use inclusive forms here, as Paul clearly addresses believers.

## Practical Guidelines for Translators

### When to Use Inclusive "We"
1. **Clear community statements:** "We are the body of Christ"
2. **Shared experiences:** "We have received grace"
3. **Universal prayers:** The Lord's Prayer
4. **Invitations:** "Let us draw near to God"

### When to Use Exclusive "We"
1. **Apostolic authority:** "We saw and testify"
2. **Specific group references:** "We Jews" or "We Gentiles"
3. **Historical narratives:** "We sailed from Troas"
4. **Role distinctions:** "We preach, you believed"

### Gray Areas Requiring Interpretation
1. Paul's letters - apostolic vs. communal voice
2. Jesus' teachings - discipleship levels
3. Prophetic passages - speaker identification
4. Narrative perspectives - observer vs. participant

## Language-Specific Examples from Our TSV

### Languages Requiring These Decisions

**High-Impact Languages (many speakers):**
- Tagalog (tgl) - 20+ million speakers
- Indonesian (ind) - 200+ million speakers
- Malay (zlm) - 30+ million speakers

**PNG Languages (high concentration):**
- 50+ Austronesian languages requiring clusivity decisions
- Each translation team must establish consistent principles

**Native American Languages:**
- Algonquin (alq) - Complex person system
- Various others with clusivity and obviation

## Documentation Needs

For each translation project, document:

1. **Clusivity decisions for key passages**
   - Lord's Prayer
   - Great Commission
   - Unity passages (John 17)
   - Paul's "we" statements

2. **Guiding principles adopted**
   - Default assumptions (inclusive vs. exclusive)
   - Theological framework
   - Consistency rules

3. **Difficult passages identified**
   - Ambiguous contexts
   - Multiple valid interpretations
   - Translation team rationale

## Impact on AI Bible Tools

### The TBTA Challenge

AI systems trained on Bible texts must:
1. Recognize clusivity as a semantic feature
2. Understand that translations make theological choices
3. Not flatten meaningful distinctions
4. Provide appropriate context for interpretation

### Data Requirements

Commentary files should include:
- Pronoun analysis for each verse
- Clusivity decisions made and rationale
- Alternative interpretations
- Cross-reference to similar decisions
