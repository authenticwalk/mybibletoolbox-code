## Rule 3.3: Role-Based "We" (8 verses)

### Verse 76: 1 John 1:1-3

**Text**: "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched—this we proclaim concerning the Word of life...We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us."

**Context**: Apostolic eyewitness testimony to readers who were not present
**Speaker**: Apostles (John and companions)
**Addressee**: Readers/believers who were not eyewitnesses
**Action**: "We have seen/heard/touched" + "proclaim to you" + "fellowship with us"

**Analysis**:
- Level 1: Clear speaker (apostles) vs addressee (readers) distinction
- Level 2 Priority Rules:
  - Rule 2.1 (Prayer)? NO - not addressed to deity
  - Rule 2.3 (We/You contrast)? YES - "we proclaim to YOU" + "you may have fellowship with US"
  - Also matches Rule 2.6 (Apostolic witness): eyewitness testimony to non-witnesses

**Rule Applied**: 2.3 (We/You contrast) + 2.6 (Apostolic witness)
**Prediction**: EXCLUSIVE
**Confidence**: 95%
**Reasoning**: Clear apostolic testimony with explicit we/you distinction. Eyewitnesses speaking to non-eyewitnesses. The phrase "fellowship with us" implies pre-existing group that addressees join.

---

### Verse 77: 1 John 4:6

**Text**: "We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood."

**Context**: Authority claim - apostolic teaching authority
**Speaker**: Apostles (John)
**Addressee**: Readers/church
**Action**: "We are from God" + "listens to us" vs "does not listen to us"

**Analysis**:
- Level 1: Speaker (apostles) claiming divine authority, addressee (readers) evaluated by response
- Level 2 Priority Rules:
  - Rule 2.1 (Prayer)? NO
  - Rule 2.3 (We/You contrast)? YES (implicit) - "whoever knows God listens to US" creates distinction
- Level 3 Secondary Rules:
  - Rule 3.3 (Authority)? YES - speaker claims authority OVER addressees (hierarchical)

**Rule Applied**: 2.3 (implicit we/you) + 3.3 (Authority over)
**Prediction**: EXCLUSIVE
**Confidence**: 90%
**Reasoning**: Apostolic authority claim with test of orthodoxy ("listens to us"). Speaker asserts superiority in discernment and teaching authority over readers.

---

### Verse 78: 3 John 1:12

**Text**: "Demetrius is well spoken of by everyone—and even by the truth itself. We also speak well of him, and you know that our testimony is true."

**Context**: Corporate endorsement with authority undertone
**Speaker**: John (elder) and companions
**Addressee**: Gaius (individual recipient)
**Action**: "We also speak well" + "our testimony is true"

**Analysis**:
- Level 1: Elder writing to church member about third party
- Level 2 Priority Rules:
  - Rule 2.1 (Prayer)? NO
  - Rule 2.3 (We/You contrast)? WEAK - "we...you know" but not strong opposition
- Level 3 Secondary Rules:
  - Rule 3.3 (Authority)? PARTIAL - speaker has authority but not harsh
  - Rule 3.1 (Shared experience)? POSSIBLE - if "you know our testimony" implies shared trust

**Analysis**: This is ambiguous. The "we" could be:
- EXCLUSIVE: John and his companions (apostolic group) distinct from Gaius
- INCLUSIVE: John and Gaius together affirming Demetrius

The phrase "you know that our testimony is true" suggests pre-existing relationship but also distinction (our testimony TO you).

**Rule Applied**: 2.6 (Apostolic witness) - testimony context
**Prediction**: EXCLUSIVE
**Confidence**: 70%
**Reasoning**: "Our testimony" suggests apostolic group distinct from recipient. Corporate endorsement from leadership to member, creating role distinction even if friendly.

### Verse 79: 1 Thessalonians 2:13

**Text**: "And we also thank God continually because, when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as a human word, but as it actually is, the word of God, which is indeed at work in you who believe."

**Context**: Teacher-to-student relationship - Paul to Thessalonians
**Speaker**: Paul and missionary team
**Addressee**: Thessalonian church
**Action**: "You received...from us" + "at work in you"

**Analysis**:
- Level 1: Clear teacher-student dynamic
- Level 2 Priority Rules:
  - Rule 2.1 (Prayer)? NO
  - Rule 2.3 (We/You contrast)? YES - "you received from US" + "at work in YOU"
- Also thanksgiving context: "we thank God...for you"

**Rule Applied**: 2.3 (We/You contrast)
**Prediction**: EXCLUSIVE
**Confidence**: 95%
**Reasoning**: Explicit we/you distinction with teacher-student roles. Missionaries gave, Thessalonians received. Clear role-based separation.

---

### Verse 80: 2 Thessalonians 2:15

**Text**: "So then, brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold fast to the teachings we passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter."

**Context**: Apostolic tradition transmission
**Speaker**: Paul and missionary team
**Addressee**: Thessalonian church
**Action**: "Hold to teachings we passed on to you"

**Analysis**:
- Level 1: Authority figure giving instruction
- Level 2 Priority Rules:
  - Rule 2.1 (Prayer)? NO
  - Rule 2.3 (We/You contrast)? YES - "we passed on to YOU"
- Level 3: Rule 3.3 (Authority)? YES - teaching authority

**Rule Applied**: 2.3 (We/You contrast) + 3.3 (Authority)
**Prediction**: EXCLUSIVE
**Confidence**: 95%
**Reasoning**: Clear transmission from teachers ("we") to students ("you"). Apostolic authority passing on tradition. Despite "brothers" address, role distinction is maintained.

---

### Verse 81: 1 Corinthians 2:6-7

**Text**: "We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, though not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing. No, we declare God's wisdom, a mystery that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began."

**Context**: Esoteric teaching - wisdom for the "mature"
**Speaker**: Paul (and apostles)
**Addressee**: Corinthian church (mixed audience of mature and immature)
**Action**: "We speak wisdom among the mature"

**Analysis**:
- Level 1: Teaching about special wisdom
- Level 2 Priority Rules:
  - Rule 2.1 (Prayer)? NO
  - Rule 2.3 (We/You contrast)? NOT EXPLICIT but implied ("we speak AMONG the mature")
- Level 3 Secondary Rules:
  - Rule 3.1 (Shared experience)? POSSIBLE if "our glory" includes addressees
  - Rule 3.3 (Authority)? YES if "we speak" distinguishes teachers from learners

**Analysis**: The key phrase is "among the mature" - does this mean:
- EXCLUSIVE: We teachers speak this wisdom, and the mature can receive it (role distinction)
- INCLUSIVE: We (speaker + mature addressees) share this wisdom together

The phrase "our glory" at the end is important - if "our" = all believers, then INCLUSIVE for that phrase. But "we speak" seems to identify teachers specifically.

**Rule Applied**: 3.3 (Authority - teaching role)
**Prediction**: EXCLUSIVE
**Confidence**: 75%
**Reasoning**: "We speak...among the mature" suggests teachers (we) addressing students (mature ones among you). Despite addressing some as "mature," maintains teacher role distinction.

---

### Verse 82: Hebrews 2:1-3

**Text**: "We must pay the most careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away. For since the message spoken through angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment, how shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him."

**Context**: Author including readers in exhortation, but with witness distinction
**Speaker**: Author of Hebrews
**Addressee**: Hebrew Christian readers
**Action**: "We must pay attention" + "how shall we escape" + "confirmed to us by those who heard"

**Analysis**:
- Level 1: Hortatory exhortation with we/us throughout
- Level 2 Priority Rules:
  - Rule 2.1 (Prayer)? NO
  - Rule 2.4 (Reciprocal)? NO
  - Rule 2.5a (Joint action invitation)? YES - "We must pay attention...we do not drift...we escape"
- But note: "confirmed to us by those who heard" - this creates witness distinction

**Analysis**: This is complex because it has BOTH:
1. "We must pay attention" - seems INCLUSIVE (speaker + readers together)
2. "Confirmed to us by those who heard" - seems EXCLUSIVE (we second-generation believers distinct from original witnesses)

The question: Does "we" shift referent, or is it consistent?

Looking at context: The author is NOT claiming to be an eyewitness but rather including himself with readers as second-generation believers who received testimony.

**Rule Applied**: 3.1 (Shared experience) - author and readers share same status as non-eyewitnesses
**Prediction**: INCLUSIVE
**Confidence**: 80%
**Reasoning**: Hortatory "we must" joins author and readers in shared status as recipients of apostolic testimony. The phrase "confirmed to us by those who heard" distinguishes both author AND readers from eyewitnesses, creating shared experience.

### Verse 83: Revelation 1:4

**Text**: "John, To the seven churches in the province of Asia: Grace and peace to you from him who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits before his throne, and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood..."

**Context**: Communal blessing with prophetic authority
**Speaker**: John (apostle/prophet)
**Addressee**: Seven churches
**Action**: "To him who loves us and has freed us"

**Analysis**:
- Level 1: Letter opening with blessing
- Level 2 Priority Rules:
  - Rule 2.1 (Prayer)? NO - this is benediction/blessing, not prayer TO God but FROM God
  - Rule 2.3 (We/You contrast)? NO - "Grace to you...who loves us" doesn't create opposition
- Level 3 Secondary Rules:
  - Rule 3.1 (Shared experience)? YES - "loves us and freed us" = shared salvation experience
  - Rule 3.3 (Authority)? WEAK - John has prophetic authority but not asserting it hierarchically here

**Analysis**: The "us" in "loves us and freed us" appears in blessing context. Does it include:
- EXCLUSIVE: John and apostolic community, offered as blessing to "you" churches
- INCLUSIVE: John and the seven churches together (shared recipients of Christ's love and salvation)

The structure is: "To YOU [churches]...grace from...Jesus who loves US and freed US"

This creates ambiguity. But in blessing contexts, the "us" typically includes addressees in shared benefit.

**Rule Applied**: 3.1 (Shared experience) - shared salvation
**Prediction**: INCLUSIVE
**Confidence**: 75%
**Reasoning**: Blessing context where "loves us and freed us" describes shared salvation experience of both John and the churches. Not asserting hierarchical distinction but rather shared identity in Christ.

## Rule 3.2: Ethnic/Religious Groups (8 verses)

### Verse 84: Romans 3:28-29

**Text**: "For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law. Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too..."

**Context**: Paul arguing for universal justification while using "we"
**Speaker**: Paul
**Addressee**: Roman church (mixed Jewish and Gentile)
**Action**: "We maintain" (assertion about justification)

**Analysis**:
- Level 1: Theological argument about universal salvation
- Level 2 Priority Rules:
  - Rule 2.1 (Prayer)? NO
  - Rule 2.3 (We/You contrast)? NO
- Level 3 Secondary Rules:
  - Rule 3.1 (Shared experience)? POSSIBLE - if "we" = all believers
  - Rule 3.2 (Group distinction)? POSSIBLE - if "we" = Paul and specific group
  - Rule 3.3 (Authority)? WEAK - Paul teaching but not hierarchically

**Analysis**: The key question is who is the "we" in "we maintain/hold"?
- EXCLUSIVE: We Jews/we apostles/we who understand correctly
- INCLUSIVE: We all believers (including Roman readers)

The context argues AGAINST ethnic distinction (God of both Jews and Gentiles). Paul is making universal claim. "We maintain" likely means "we Christians" or "we who understand the gospel" - which would include his addressees.

**Rule Applied**: 3.1 (Shared experience) - shared theological understanding
**Prediction**: INCLUSIVE
**Confidence**: 70%
**Reasoning**: Paul arguing for universal justification would naturally use INCLUSIVE "we" to include both Jewish and Gentile believers in shared theological conviction. The argument's logic (God of all) supports inclusive reading.

---

### Verse 85: Galatians 2:14-15

**Text**: "When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of them all, 'You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs? We who are Jews by birth and not sinful Gentiles...'"

**Context**: Explicit ethnic identity claim - Paul to Peter
**Speaker**: Paul
**Addressee**: Peter (and others present)
**Action**: "We who are Jews by birth"

**Analysis**:
- Level 1: Clear ethnic identification
- Level 2 Priority Rules:
  - Rule 2.1 (Prayer)? NO
  - Rule 2.3 (We/You contrast)? YES - "YOU are a Jew" + "WE who are Jews"
- Level 3 Secondary Rules:
  - Rule 3.2 (Group distinction)? YES - explicit ethnic boundary marker

**Rule Applied**: 3.2 (Ethnic group distinction)
**Prediction**: EXCLUSIVE
**Confidence**: 95%
**Reasoning**: Explicit ethnic identity claim: "We who are Jews by birth and not sinful Gentiles." Clear boundary marker distinguishing Jews (Paul and Peter) from Gentiles. This is marked EXCLUSIVE.

---

### Verse 86: Ephesians 2:14-16

**Text**: "For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility, by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two, thus making peace, and in one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility."

**Context**: Theological teaching about unifying Jews and Gentiles
**Speaker**: Paul
**Addressee**: Ephesian church (mixed Jewish/Gentile)
**Action**: "He is our peace...made the two groups one"

**Analysis**:
- Level 1: Teaching about Christ reconciling ethnic groups
- Level 2 Priority Rules:
  - Rule 2.1 (Prayer)? NO
  - Rule 2.3 (We/You contrast)? NO
- Level 3 Secondary Rules:
  - Rule 3.1 (Shared experience)? YES - "our peace" = shared reconciliation
  - Rule 3.2 (Group distinction)? NO - explicitly rejecting distinction ("made one")

**Analysis**: The "our" in "our peace" appears in context of eliminating boundaries. Paul is teaching that Christ has made "the two groups" (Jews and Gentiles) into "one new humanity."

The question: Does "our peace" mean:
- EXCLUSIVE: We Jews' peace (Paul addressing from Jewish perspective)
- INCLUSIVE: Our (all believers') peace

Given context of unity and "one new humanity," the "our" likely includes all addressees (both Jewish and Gentile believers).

**Rule Applied**: 3.1 (Shared experience) - shared reconciliation and peace
**Prediction**: INCLUSIVE
**Confidence**: 85%
**Reasoning**: Context explicitly teaches elimination of ethnic boundaries and creation of "one new humanity." "Our peace" refers to shared benefit of reconciliation for all believers (Jewish and Gentile).

---

### Verse 87: 1 Thessalonians 2:14-16

**Text**: "For you, brothers and sisters, became imitators of God's churches in Judea, which are in Christ Jesus: You suffered from your own people the same things those churches suffered from the Jews who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and also drove us out. They displease God and are hostile to everyone..."

**Context**: Persecution narrative with ethnic/religious opposition
**Speaker**: Paul and missionary team
**Addressee**: Thessalonian church (Gentile)
**Action**: "Drove us out" + "you suffered...they suffered...from the Jews"

**Analysis**:
- Level 1: Comparing persecution experiences
- Level 2 Priority Rules:
  - Rule 2.1 (Prayer)? NO
  - Rule 2.3 (We/You contrast)? YES - "YOU suffered...drove US out"
- Level 3 Secondary Rules:
  - Rule 3.2 (Group distinction)? YES - "the Jews" as hostile group

**Analysis**: The "us" in "drove us out" refers to Paul and missionary team, who experienced persecution by "the Jews." The addressees (Thessalonians) are compared to Judean churches but distinguished from Paul's group.

Structure: YOU (Thessalonians) suffered like THEM (Judean churches) from YOUR persecutors, just as THEY suffered from the Jews who also persecuted US.

**Rule Applied**: 2.3 (We/You contrast) + 3.2 (Group distinction)
**Prediction**: EXCLUSIVE
**Confidence**: 90%
**Reasoning**: Clear we/you distinction: "you suffered...drove us out." Paul's missionary team (we) is distinguished from Thessalonian addressees (you) even though both experienced persecution.

---

### Verse 88: Colossians 3:11

**Text**: "Here there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all."

**Context**: Teaching about corporate identity transcending boundaries
**Speaker**: Paul
**Addressee**: Colossian church
**Action**: (No explicit first-person plural pronoun in this verse)

**Analysis**: Looking at the verse, I don't see "we/us/our" pronouns. The verse is third-person theological statement: "there is no...but Christ is in all."

Let me check if this is the right verse or if I need to look at surrounding context...

**Problem**: This verse doesn't contain first-person plural pronouns to analyze for clusivity.

**Resolution**: This may be an error in the test set, or the clusivity judgment is about the implicit "we/us" in "all" or requires broader context. I'll look at the immediate context (verses 9-11):

"Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator. Here there is no Gentile or Jew..."

Ah! The broader context has "you have taken off" and then "here there is" - the "here" implies "among us/in us/in our community."

**Rule Applied**: 3.1 (Shared experience) - implicit "among us"
**Prediction**: INCLUSIVE
**Confidence**: 70%
**Reasoning**: While no explicit first-person plural pronoun, the context implies "among us/in us there is no distinction." Paul includes himself and addressees in renewed humanity transcending ethnic boundaries.

---

### Verse 89: Acts 26:4-5

**Text**: "The Jewish people all know the way I lived ever since I was a child, from the beginning of my life in my own country, and also in Jerusalem. They have known me for a long time and can testify, if they are willing, that I conformed to the strictest sect of our religion, living as a Pharisee."

**Context**: Paul claiming shared Jewish identity in his defense
**Speaker**: Paul
**Addressee**: King Agrippa and audience (including Jews)
**Action**: "Our religion" (referring to Judaism)

**Analysis**:
- Level 1: Paul's defense speech
- Level 2 Priority Rules:
  - Rule 2.1 (Prayer)? NO
  - Rule 2.3 (We/You contrast)? NO
- Level 3 Secondary Rules:
  - Rule 3.2 (Group distinction)? YES - "our religion" = Judaism

**Analysis**: The key phrase is "our religion" (Greek: τῆς ἡμετέρας θρησκείας). Who is included in "our"?
- Paul (speaker) + Jewish witnesses (they) = shared Judaism
- Does it include Agrippa? (He was somewhat Jewish)
- Does it include non-Jewish audience? NO

This is clearly ethnic/religious boundary marker. Paul is saying "our Jewish religion" to establish credentials.

**Rule Applied**: 3.2 (Ethnic/religious group distinction)
**Prediction**: EXCLUSIVE
**Confidence**: 90%
**Reasoning**: "Our religion" refers to Judaism, shared by Paul and Jewish witnesses but excluding Gentile audience members. Ethnic/religious boundary marker establishing Jewish credentials.

---

### Verse 90: 2 Corinthians 11:22

**Text**: "Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham's descendants? So am I. Are they servants of Christ? (I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am more."

**Context**: Paul asserting apostolic identity within Jewish group
**Speaker**: Paul
**Addressee**: Corinthian church
**Action**: "So am I" (claiming shared identity with opponents)

**Analysis**: Looking at this verse, I see "I/I am" but no explicit "we/us/our" in the quoted portion. Let me check if there's a first-person plural elsewhere...

Actually, there's no first-person plural pronoun in this verse. Paul is using first-person SINGULAR throughout ("I am").

**Problem**: No first-person plural pronoun to analyze.

**Resolution**: This might be an error in the test set selection, OR the test is about implicit group membership. Paul is claiming membership in ethnic groups ("Hebrews, Israelites, Abraham's descendants") - the question might be about whether he's using these categories inclusively or exclusively relative to his audience.

If I must make a judgment: Paul is claiming shared identity with his opponents (who are Jewish), distinguishing himself from Gentile Corinthians in these ethnic terms.

**Tentative Rule Applied**: 3.2 (Ethnic group distinction) - implicit
**Tentative Prediction**: EXCLUSIVE (if forced to judge)
**Confidence**: 50%
**Reasoning**: While no explicit first-person plural, Paul claims ethnic Jewish identity shared with opponents but not with Gentile Corinthians. However, this verse may not be appropriate for clusivity analysis without explicit pronouns.

---

### Verse 91: Philippians 3:5-6

**Text**: "circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee; as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for righteousness based on the law, faultless."

**Context**: Paul listing ethnic/religious credentials he has renounced
**Speaker**: Paul
**Addressee**: Philippian church
**Action**: Listing ethnic identity (first-person singular, no plural pronouns)

**Analysis**: Again, this verse uses first-person SINGULAR throughout. Paul is listing his personal credentials: "I was circumcised...I am of the people of Israel..."

**Problem**: No first-person plural pronoun in this verse.

**Resolution**: This appears to be another test set error, or the test requires looking at broader context. Let me check the surrounding verses:

Verse 3: "For it is we who are the circumcision, we who serve God by his Spirit, who boast in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh"

Ah! Verse 3 has "we" - perhaps that's what should be tested?

**If testing verse 3**: "We who are the circumcision" - this is Paul redefining "circumcision" spiritually to include all Christians (Jewish and Gentile), in contrast to physical circumcision.

**Rule Applied**: 3.1 (Shared experience) - redefined spiritual identity
**Prediction**: INCLUSIVE
**Confidence**: 75%
**Reasoning**: Paul uses "we" to include all believers (Jewish and Gentile) in redefined "true circumcision" based on Spirit, not ethnicity. Context shows he's transcending ethnic boundaries.

## Rule 3.1: Shared Experience (9 verses)

### Verse 92: Romans 6:3-4

**Text**: "Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life."

**Context**: Shared sacramental experience (baptism)
**Speaker**: Paul
**Addressee**: Roman Christians
**Action**: "All of us who were baptized" + "we were buried" + "we too may live"

**Analysis**:
- Level 1: Teaching about baptism using inclusive "all of us"
- Level 2 Priority Rules:
  - Rule 2.1 (Prayer)? NO
  - Rule 2.3 (We/You contrast)? NO
  - Rule 2.4 (Reciprocal)? NO but close (shared mutual experience)
- Level 3 Secondary Rules:
  - Rule 3.1 (Shared experience)? YES - "all of us who were baptized"

**Rule Applied**: 3.1 (Shared experience) - shared baptism and its effects
**Prediction**: INCLUSIVE
**Confidence**: 95%
**Reasoning**: Explicit "all of us who were baptized" includes both Paul and Roman addressees in shared sacramental experience and its theological significance. Clear inclusive language.

---

### Verse 93: 1 Corinthians 10:1-4

**Text**: "For I do not want you to be ignorant of the fact, brothers and sisters, that our ancestors were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea. They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. They all ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ."

**Context**: Paul identifying with ancestral exodus experience
**Speaker**: Paul
**Addressee**: Corinthian church (mixed Jewish/Gentile)
**Action**: "Our ancestors" (identification with Israelite exodus)

**Analysis**:
- Level 1: Typological teaching connecting exodus to Christian experience
- Level 2 Priority Rules:
  - Rule 2.1 (Prayer)? NO
  - Rule 2.3 (We/You contrast)? NO
- Level 3 Secondary Rules:
  - Rule 3.1 (Shared experience)? POSSIBLE - identifying with spiritual heritage
  - Rule 3.2 (Group distinction)? POSSIBLE - ethnic boundary (Jewish history)

**Analysis**: The key phrase is "our ancestors" (οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν). Who is included?
- EXCLUSIVE: Our (we Jews') ancestors - Paul addressing from Jewish perspective
- INCLUSIVE: Our (all Christians') spiritual ancestors - including Gentile believers

Context is important: Paul is writing to Corinthians (majority Gentile) and calling Israelites "our ancestors." This is either:
1. Paul using ethnic "our" (we Jews)
2. Paul claiming spiritual ancestry for all Christians

Given that Paul argues elsewhere that Gentile believers are "children of Abraham" by faith (Galatians 3), and the context here is about spiritual realities (spiritual food, spiritual rock = Christ), this likely INCLUSIVE spiritual identification.

**Rule Applied**: 3.1 (Shared experience) - shared spiritual heritage
**Prediction**: INCLUSIVE
**Confidence**: 75%
**Reasoning**: Paul includes Gentile Corinthians in "our ancestors" by claiming shared spiritual heritage through Christ. The emphasis on "spiritual" food/drink/rock supports inclusive reading over ethnic boundary.

---

### Verse 94: 1 Corinthians 12:12-13

**Text**: "Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its parts form one body, so it is with Christ. For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body—whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink."

**Context**: Shared incorporation across ethnic and social divides
**Speaker**: Paul
**Addressee**: Corinthian church
**Action**: "We were all baptized" + "we were all given"

**Analysis**:
- Level 1: Unity teaching with explicit "all" language
- Level 2 Priority Rules:
  - Rule 2.1 (Prayer)? NO
  - Rule 2.3 (We/You contrast)? NO
  - Rule 2.4 (Reciprocal)? CLOSE - mutual incorporation
- Level 3 Secondary Rules:
  - Rule 3.1 (Shared experience)? YES - "we were all baptized"

**Rule Applied**: 3.1 (Shared experience) - shared Spirit baptism
**Prediction**: INCLUSIVE
**Confidence**: 95%
**Reasoning**: Explicit "we were all" language with specific inclusion of diverse groups ("Jews or Gentiles, slave or free"). Clear inclusive statement of shared spiritual experience.

---

### Verse 95: 2 Corinthians 5:1-5

**Text**: "For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands. Meanwhile we groan, longing to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling... Now the one who has fashioned us for this very purpose is God, who has given us the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come."

**Context**: Shared eschatological hope and current condition
**Speaker**: Paul
**Addressee**: Corinthian church
**Action**: "We know" + "we have" + "we groan" + "we live" + "our heavenly dwelling"

**Analysis**:
- Level 1: Teaching about resurrection hope using "we" throughout
- Level 2 Priority Rules:
  - Rule 2.1 (Prayer)? NO
  - Rule 2.3 (We/You contrast)? NO
- Level 3 Secondary Rules:
  - Rule 3.1 (Shared experience)? YES - shared mortality, hope, groaning, Spirit

**Rule Applied**: 3.1 (Shared experience) - shared present condition and future hope
**Prediction**: INCLUSIVE
**Confidence**: 90%
**Reasoning**: Paul uses "we" throughout to include himself and Corinthian readers in shared present condition (mortality, groaning), shared possession (heavenly dwelling), and shared guarantee (Spirit). No indication of distinction.

---

### Verse 96: Ephesians 4:3-6

**Text**: "Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."

**Context**: Asserting shared corporate identity
**Speaker**: Paul
**Addressee**: Ephesian church
**Action**: Teaching about unity (but checking for first-person plural pronouns...)

**Analysis**: Looking at verses 3-6, I see second-person ("you were called") and third-person ("one body...one Spirit...one God"), but I don't see explicit first-person plural pronouns in these specific verses.

Let me check verses 1-6 more carefully:
- V1: "I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you..."
- V2: (second person imperatives)
- V3: "Make every effort..." (imperative)
- V4-6: "There is one body..." (third person)

The broader context (vv. 1-16) may have "we" elsewhere. Let me check:

Verse 4:7: "But to each one of us grace has been given"
Verse 4:13: "until we all reach unity"
Verse 4:14: "Then we will no longer be infants"

Ah! Verses 13-14 have "we" - that's probably what's being tested.

**If testing verses 13-14**: "Until we all reach unity in the faith...Then we will no longer be infants"

### Verse 97: Colossians 1:15-20

**Text**: "The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation... He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy... and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross."

**Context**: Christological hymn about cosmic reconciliation
**Speaker**: Paul
**Addressee**: Colossian church
**Action**: Third-person description of Christ

**Analysis**: This passage is entirely third-person ("He is...his blood"). I don't see first-person plural pronouns in verses 15-20.

Let me check if there's context nearby with "we/us/our":

Verse 12: "...giving joyful thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance"
Verse 13: "For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness"
Verse 14: "in whom we have redemption"

Ah! Verses 12-14 have first-person plural. The test might be about verse 13-14.

**If testing verses 13-14**: "He has rescued us...in whom we have redemption"

**Rule Applied**: 3.1 (Shared experience) - shared rescue and redemption
**Prediction**: INCLUSIVE
**Confidence**: 85%
**Reasoning**: Paul includes himself and Colossian readers in shared experience of rescue from darkness and redemption in Christ. Follows thanksgiving addressed to "Father" which transitions to shared benefits.

### Verse 98: 1 Peter 2:4-9

**Text**: "As you come to him, the living Stone—rejected by humans but chosen by God and precious to him—you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ... But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light."

**Context**: Shared priestly identity claim
**Speaker**: Peter
**Addressee**: Christians scattered throughout Asia Minor
**Action**: Second-person ("you are a chosen people, royal priesthood")

**Analysis**: This passage uses second-person plural throughout ("you are...you also..."). I don't see explicit first-person plural pronouns in verses 4-9.

However, the broader context might have "we":
Verse 2:24: "He himself bore our sins...that we might die to sins and live for righteousness"
Verse 2:25: "For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned"

**If testing verse 24**: "He bore our sins...that we might die to sins"

**Rule Applied**: 3.1 (Shared experience) - shared atonement and transformation
**Prediction**: INCLUSIVE
**Confidence**: 85%
**Reasoning**: "Our sins" and "we might die to sins" includes Peter and readers in shared experience of Christ's atonement and its transformative effects.

**Text**: "I, John, your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus."

**Context**: John claiming shared experience with readers
**Speaker**: John
**Addressee**: Seven churches
**Action**: "Your brother and companion...that are ours"

**Analysis**:
- Level 1: John identifying with readers

**Rule Applied**: 3.1 (Shared experience) - shared suffering, kingdom, endurance
**Prediction**: INCLUSIVE
**Confidence**: 95%
**Reasoning**: John explicitly identifies as "brother and companion" in experiences "that are ours" - clear language of shared experience between author and readers in Jesus.

### Verse 100: Titus 3:4-7

**Text**: "But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life."

**Context**: Shared salvation history
**Speaker**: Paul
**Addressee**: Titus (and through him, Cretan churches)
**Action**: "He saved us" + "poured out on us" + "we might become heirs"

**Analysis**:
- Level 1: Recounting salvation experience
- Level 2 Priority Rules:
  - Rule 2.1 (Prayer)? NO
  - Rule 2.3 (We/You contrast)? NO
- Level 3 Secondary Rules:
  - Rule 3.1 (Shared experience)? YES - "saved us...poured out on us...we become heirs"

**Rule Applied**: 3.1 (Shared experience) - shared salvation experience
**Prediction**: INCLUSIVE
**Confidence**: 90%
**Reasoning**: Paul includes himself and Titus/Cretan believers in shared experience of salvation ("he saved us"), Holy Spirit reception ("poured out on us"), and inheritance ("we might become heirs"). No indication of distinction.
