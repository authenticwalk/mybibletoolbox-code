## Adversarial Test Predictions (15 verses)

### 1. Isaiah 9:6 - "For to us a child is born"

**Text**: "For to us a child is born, to us a son is given"

**Analysis**:
- Speaker: Prophet/God speaking through prophet
- Addressee: Israel/all who receive
- Pronoun: "us" (appears twice)
- Action: Receiving child/son (Messiah)
- Context: Messianic prophecy

**Algorithm Application**:
- Check Rule 2.2 (Divine speech to humans): Partial match - prophet speaking
- Check Rule 3.1 (Shared experience): Could apply if "us" = all recipients
- Check Rule 3.2 (Ethnic group): Could apply if "us" = Israel specifically
- Theological context: Universal offer vs. Israel-specific

**Prediction**: **AMBIGUOUS → Primary: INCLUSIVE**

**Reasoning**: The messianic gift is offered to recipients. If "us" = Israel receiving from God, it's INCLUSIVE of addressee (Israel). If "us" = Israel vs. other nations, could be EXCLUSIVE. The invitation/gift context suggests INCLUSIVE (Rule 3.1 - shared experience of receiving).

**Confidence**: **LOW (40%)** - Genuine theological ambiguity

**Alternative**: EXCLUSIVE if "us" = Israel as distinct ethnic group (Rule 3.2)

---

### 2. Psalm 44:1 - "We have heard with our ears"

**Text**: "We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us"

**Analysis**:
- Speaker: Psalmist representing current generation
- Addressee: God (in prayer)
- Pronoun: "we/our/us"
- Action: Hearing from fathers (shared historical memory)
- Context: Corporate Israel across generations

**Algorithm Application**:
- Rule 2.1 (Prayer to God): "O God" indicates prayer context
- But "we" is not possession ("our God") but action ("we have heard")
- Rule 3.1 (Shared experience): Current generation shares hearing from fathers
- Discourse role: Corporate solidarity (current generation + psalmist)

**Prediction**: **INCLUSIVE**

**Reasoning**: The psalmist is addressing God in prayer, but the "we" refers to the current generation including both speaker and addressees (other Israelites). This is shared experience of hearing from fathers. Prayer rule (2.1) doesn't apply because "we" is the subject, not possessive.

**Confidence**: **MEDIUM (70%)** - Discourse complexity but shared experience is clear

---

### 3. Numbers 23:19 - (Verification needed)

**Text**: "God is not man, that he should lie, not a son of man, that he should change his mind"

**Analysis**:
- **PROBLEM**: No first-person plural pronoun found in this verse
- Balaam's oracle about God's nature

**Prediction**: **NOT APPLICABLE** - No clusivity test in this verse

**Confidence**: **HIGH (95%)** - Verse doesn't contain "we/us/our"

**Action**: Replace with alternative verse or mark as verification failure

---

### 4. 1 John 4:19 - "We love because he first loved us"

**Text**: "We love because he first loved us"

**Analysis**:
- Speaker: John
- Addressee: Believers (readers)
- Pronouns: "We" (subject) and "us" (object)
- "We love" - who is "we"?
- "Us" - who is "us"?
- Context: Epistle, teaching about love

**Algorithm Application**:
- Rule 3.1 (Shared experience): "He first loved us" = all believers (INCLUSIVE of addressees)
- "We love" - response to being loved
- John writing to believers about shared experience

**Prediction**: **INCLUSIVE**

**Reasoning**: Both "we" and "us" include John + addressees (all believers). This is shared experience of being loved by God and responding in love. Classic Pauline/Johannine pattern of identifying with readers.

**Confidence**: **HIGH (85%)** - Standard epistle pattern of shared experience

---

### 5. Genesis 42:21 - "We are guilty concerning our brother"

**Text**: "Then they said to one another, 'In truth we are guilty concerning our brother'"

**Analysis**:
- Speaker: Brothers (as group)
- Addressee: Each other (one another)
- Pronoun: "we/our"
- Action: Acknowledging guilt about Joseph
- Context: Joseph is present but unrecognized

**Algorithm Application**:
- Rule 3.1 (Shared experience): Brothers share guilt
- "To one another" = speaking within the group
- All brothers are included in "we"
- Joseph is the object ("our brother"), not part of "we"

**Prediction**: **INCLUSIVE** (of all brothers speaking) but **EXCLUSIVE** (of Joseph)

**Reasoning**: This is inclusive of all brothers participating in the conversation ("one another" = reciprocal, all included). Joseph is excluded because he's the object of discussion and they think he doesn't understand Hebrew.

**Confidence**: **HIGH (90%)** - Clear reciprocal pattern (Rule 2.4)

---

### 6. Jeremiah 42:20 - "Pray for us to the LORD our God"

**Text**: "For you have gone astray at the cost of your lives, for you sent me to the LORD your God, saying, 'Pray for us to the LORD our God'"

**Analysis**:
- Outer speaker: Jeremiah (prophet)
- Inner quote speaker: People (to Jeremiah)
- Addressee (inner): Jeremiah
- Pronoun in inner quote: "us...our God"
- Context: People asking for prayer

**Algorithm Application**:
- Inner quote: "Pray for us" = people asking Jeremiah to pray
- "Our God" = people's God (but is Jeremiah included?)
- Rule 2.1 context: Prayer TO God
- Jeremiah is mediator, people are asking him to pray FOR them

**Prediction**: **AMBIGUOUS → Primary: INCLUSIVE**

**Reasoning**: "Our God" likely includes Jeremiah (all share same God). But "for us" might be EXCLUSIVE if Jeremiah as prophet is distinct from people. Leaning INCLUSIVE because shared covenant relationship.

**Confidence**: **MEDIUM (65%)** - Prophet mediator role creates ambiguity

---

### 7. Song of Solomon 1:4 - "We will exult and rejoice in you"

**Text**: "We will exult and rejoice in you; we will extol your love"

**Analysis**:
- Speaker: Daughters of Jerusalem / Chorus (likely)
- Addressee: Beloved (bride's object of praise)
- Pronouns: "we" (appears twice)
- Action: Rejoicing, extolling
- Context: Poetry, unclear speaker attribution

**Algorithm Application**:
- Need to identify speaker clearly
- If Daughters of Jerusalem: speaking together (INCLUSIVE within group)
- Addressee (beloved) is object ("in you"), not participant
- Like worship invitation pattern but different context

**Prediction**: **INCLUSIVE** (within chorus)

**Reasoning**: Multiple speakers praising together, reciprocal action. All who speak share in the rejoicing. Similar to worship invitation (Rule 2.5) but poetry context.

**Confidence**: **MEDIUM (70%)** - Speaker identification uncertainty

---

### 8. Acts 16:10 - "Immediately we sought to go"

**Text**: "When he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go on into Macedonia"

**Analysis**:
- Speaker: Luke (author/narrator)
- "We" = Luke + Paul + companions (travel party)
- Addressee: Readers (not present at event)
- Action: Seeking to go to Macedonia
- Context: "We" section begins (narrative shift from "they" to "we")

**Algorithm Application**:
- Rule 2.6 analogy: Historical witness/travel narrative
- Readers were not present
- "We" = author's travel group only
- Clear EXCLUSIVE pattern

**Prediction**: **EXCLUSIVE**

**Reasoning**: Classic narrative "we" = author + companions, excluding readers. Readers were not on the journey. Similar to apostolic witness pattern (Rule 2.6).

**Confidence**: **HIGH (95%)** - Clear narrative pattern

---

### 9. Daniel 2:36 - "Now we will tell the king"

**Text**: "This was the dream. Now we will tell the king its interpretation"

**Analysis**:
- Speaker: Daniel
- Addressee: King Nebuchadnezzar (probably)
- Pronoun: "we"
- Context: Daniel interpreting dream
- Question: Who is "we"?

**Algorithm Application**:
- Options:
  a) Royal "we" (Daniel alone using plural) - how to classify?
  b) Daniel + God (prophetic plural)
  c) Daniel + companions (Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego)
- If (a): Singular speaker using plural - treat as EXCLUSIVE?
- If (b): Daniel + God to king → EXCLUSIVE (king can't participate)
- If (c): Daniel + companions to king → could be either

**Prediction**: **AMBIGUOUS → Primary: EXCLUSIVE**

**Reasoning**: Most likely Daniel + God prophetic collaboration, or Daniel + companions. Either way, king is not included in the interpretive act. Leaning EXCLUSIVE.

**Confidence**: **LOW (50%)** - Uncertain referent for "we"

---

### 10. Nehemiah 2:17 - "The trouble we are in...let us build"

**Text**: "Then I said to them, 'You see the trouble we are in, how Jerusalem lies in ruins. Come, let us build the wall of Jerusalem'"

**Analysis**:
- Speaker: Nehemiah
- Addressee: People of Jerusalem
- Pronouns: "we" (first occurrence), "us" (second occurrence)
- First "we": "the trouble we are in" = Nehemiah + people
- Second "us": "let us build" = invitation to build together

**Algorithm Application**:
- First "we": Rule 3.1 (Shared problem) → INCLUSIVE
- Second "us": Rule 2.5 (Invitation pattern like worship) → INCLUSIVE
- Nehemiah identifies with people's problem, invites to shared solution

**Prediction**: **INCLUSIVE** (both instances)

**Reasoning**: Nehemiah explicitly includes himself in the problem ("we are in") and solution ("let us build"). Classic leadership pattern of identifying with group. Very similar to worship invitation structure.

**Confidence**: **HIGH (90%)** - Clear invitation pattern

---

### 11. Galatians 4:28 context - (Need to locate "we")

**Text**: [Need to check Galatians 4 context for nearby first-person plural]

**Analysis**:
- Galatians 4:28: "Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise"
- This verse uses "you" not "we"
- Need to find nearby "we" context

**Prediction**: **PENDING** - Need to verify verse reference

**Action**: Check Galatians 4:26-31 for first-person plural pronouns

---

### 12. James 3:1 - "We who teach will be judged"

**Text**: "Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness"

**Analysis**:
- Speaker: James
- Addressee: Brothers (believers, including some teachers)
- Pronoun: "we who teach"
- Subset reference: Not all addressees are teachers
- Action: Being judged as teachers

**Algorithm Application**:
- "We who teach" = subset of believers (teachers only)
- Is this EXCLUSIVE (teachers vs. non-teachers)?
- Or INCLUSIVE (if addressees include teachers)?
- Rule 3.3 (Hierarchical authority): Teachers have distinct role/responsibility

**Prediction**: **EXCLUSIVE**

**Reasoning**: "We who teach" is a subset distinguished from "you" who should not all become teachers. James as teacher speaking about teachers as distinct group with greater judgment. Authority/role distinction (Rule 3.3).

**Confidence**: **HIGH (85%)** - Clear role distinction

---

### 13. Ecclesiastes 4:9 - (Verification needed)

**Text**: "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil"

**Analysis**:
- **PROBLEM**: Uses "they" not "we/us/our"
- Wisdom proverb about collaboration
- May not contain first-person plural

**Prediction**: **NOT APPLICABLE** - No clusivity test if no first-person plural

**Confidence**: **HIGH (90%)** - Likely doesn't contain target pronouns

**Action**: Verify Hebrew text or replace with alternative

---

### 14. Revelation 11:8 - (Verification needed)

**Text**: "And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city...where their Lord was crucified"

**Analysis**:
- Uses third person "their" not first person "our/we/us"
- Apocalyptic vision narrative
- May not contain first-person plural in this specific verse

**Prediction**: **PENDING** - Need to verify verse or check context

**Action**: Verify Revelation 11 for first-person plural pronouns

---

### 15. Jonah 1:14 - "Let us not perish for this man's life"

**Text**: "Therefore they called out to the LORD, 'O LORD, let us not perish for this man's life'"

**Analysis**:
- Speaker: Pagan sailors
- Addressee: The LORD (YHWH)
- Pronoun: "us"
- Action: Prayer not to perish
- Context: Prayer to God

**Algorithm Application**:
- Rule 2.1 (Prayer to God): Prayer TO God → EXCLUSIVE (God not in "us")
- Pagan sailors using God's name
- Clear prayer structure ("O LORD" vocative)

**Prediction**: **EXCLUSIVE**

**Reasoning**: This is prayer TO God, so God is excluded from "us" (the sailors who might perish). Follows prayer rule (2.1) even though speakers are pagan. Rule applies universally to prayer structure.

**Confidence**: **HIGH (95%)** - Clear prayer pattern
