## Random Test Predictions (12 verses)

### OT Narrative (3 verses)

#### 1. 1 Samuel 14:40 - Saul dividing sides

**Text**: "Then he said to all Israel, 'You shall be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.' And the people said to Saul, 'Do what seems good to you.'"

**Analysis**:
- Speaker: Saul (first), people (second response)
- First-person content: "I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side"
- Uses "I" not "we" - may not contain first-person plural
- **PROBLEM**: May not have "we/us/our" pronoun

**Prediction**: **PENDING** - Need to verify first-person plural presence

**Action**: If no first-person plural, replace with alternative from 1 Samuel

---

#### 2. Joshua 24:15 - "We will serve the LORD"

**Text**: "Choose this day whom you will serve...But as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD"

**Analysis**:
- Speaker: Joshua
- Addressee: Israel (assembly)
- Pronoun: "we" (Joshua + his house)
- Action: Serving the LORD
- Context: Covenant renewal speech

**Algorithm Application**:
- Joshua speaking FOR his household
- "You" (Israel) addressed separately ("choose this day")
- "We" = Joshua + his house, contrasted with "you" (Israel)
- Rule 2.3 (Explicit contrast "we...you")

**Prediction**: **EXCLUSIVE**

**Reasoning**: "You choose...we will serve" is explicit contrast between Joshua's house and the addressees (rest of Israel). Each household must make own decision. Clear we/you distinction.

**Confidence**: **HIGH (95%)** - Explicit contrast pattern (Rule 2.3)

---

#### 3. 2 Kings 18:22 - Rabshakeh quoting Jerusalem

**Text**: "But if you say to me, 'We trust in the LORD our God,' is it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed"

**Analysis**:
- Outer speaker: Rabshakeh (Assyrian official)
- Inner quote: Jerusalem representatives (hypothetical speech)
- Addressee (outer): Jerusalem representatives
- Pronoun: "we" in quoted speech
- Context: Siege warfare, diplomatic speech

**Algorithm Application**:
- Inner quote: "We trust in the LORD our God"
- Hypothetical statement by Jerusalem about themselves
- "Our God" = Jerusalem's God
- Who is "we"? Jerusalem representatives + people

**Prediction**: **INCLUSIVE** (within quoted speech)

**Reasoning**: In the hypothetical quote, "we trust" = all of Jerusalem (speakers + people). "Our God" is shared possession. This is INCLUSIVE within the quote even though outer context is hostile.

**Confidence**: **MEDIUM (75%)** - Quoted speech complexity, but inner quote is clear shared identity

---

### OT Poetry/Wisdom (2 verses)

#### 4. Job 32:14 - Elihu's speech

**Text**: "He has not directed his words against me, and I will not answer him with your speeches"

**Analysis**:
- Uses "I" and "your" (not "we/us/our")
- **PROBLEM**: May not contain first-person plural
- Need to check nearby verses in Job 32

**Prediction**: **PENDING** - Need to verify first-person plural presence

**Action**: Check Job 32 context or replace with alternative

---

#### 5. Psalm 66:6 - "There did we rejoice in him"

**Text**: "He turned the sea into dry land; they passed through the river on foot. There did we rejoice in him"

**Analysis**:
- Speaker: Psalmist
- Addressee: Congregation/readers
- Pronoun: "we"
- Action: Rejoicing in God (historical reference to Red Sea crossing)
- Context: Psalm of praise, historical recollection

**Algorithm Application**:
- Shared historical experience (Red Sea crossing)
- Psalmist identifying with ancestors AND current hearers
- Rule 3.1 (Shared experience/identity)
- Corporate Israel across time

**Prediction**: **INCLUSIVE**

**Reasoning**: Psalmist includes self + addressees (congregation) in shared historical memory and rejoicing. Similar to Psalm 44:1 but here more clearly inclusive of current generation celebrating together.

**Confidence**: **HIGH (90%)** - Clear shared experience pattern

---

### OT Prophecy (2 verses)

#### 6. Jeremiah 3:22 - "Behold, we come to you"

**Text**: "Return, O faithless children; I will heal your faithlessness. 'Behold, we come to you, for you are the LORD our God'"

**Analysis**:
- Outer speaker: God (calling people to return)
- Inner quote: People's response (anticipated)
- Addressee (inner quote): God
- Pronoun: "we" (in response)
- Context: Prophetic oracle with quoted response

**Algorithm Application**:
- Inner quote: People responding to God
- "We come to you" = approaching God
- "You are the LORD our God" = addressing God
- Rule 2.1 context (Prayer/address to God)
- "Our God" = people's God (but does "we" exclude God?)

**Prediction**: **EXCLUSIVE**

**Reasoning**: People addressing God in repentance. "We come to you" separates the speakers (people) from addressee (God). Prayer/response to God follows Rule 2.1 pattern - God is not in "we."

**Confidence**: **HIGH (90%)** - Clear prayer pattern

---

#### 7. Ezekiel 33:10 - "We rot away...how then can we live?"

**Text**: "And you, son of man, say to the house of Israel, Thus have you said: 'Surely our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we rot away because of them. How then can we live?'"

**Analysis**:
- Outer speaker: God (to Ezekiel)
- Middle: Ezekiel (to Israel)
- Inner quote: Israel's lament (quoted by Ezekiel)
- Pronoun: "our...we" (appears twice in lament)
- Context: People's despairing statement

**Algorithm Application**:
- Inner quote: Israel lamenting together
- "Our transgressions...we rot away"
- Shared guilt, shared suffering
- "We" = all Israel suffering together
- Rule 3.1 (Shared experience)

**Prediction**: **INCLUSIVE** (within the quoted lament)

**Reasoning**: The people lamenting together about shared guilt and suffering. "We" includes all who are speaking/lamenting. This is corporate confession and despair.

**Confidence**: **HIGH (90%)** - Clear shared experience

---

### NT Narrative (2 verses)

#### 8. Mark 1:38 - "Let us go on to the next towns"

**Text**: "And he said to them, 'Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also, for that is why I came out'"

**Analysis**:
- Speaker: Jesus
- Addressee: Disciples
- Pronoun: "us"
- Action: Going to next towns
- Context: Invitation to travel together

**Algorithm Application**:
- Rule 2.5 analogy (Invitation pattern)
- Jesus inviting disciples to accompany him
- "Let us go" = Jesus + disciples
- Shared journey

**Prediction**: **INCLUSIVE**

**Reasoning**: Jesus explicitly invites disciples to go with him. "Let us go" includes both Jesus and the addressees (disciples). Classic invitation pattern, similar to worship invitation but travel context.

**Confidence**: **HIGH (95%)** - Clear invitation pattern

---

#### 9. Luke 24:29 - "Stay with us"

**Text**: "But they urged him strongly, saying, 'Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.' So he went in to stay with them"

**Analysis**:
- Speaker: Two disciples (on Emmaus road)
- Addressee: Risen Jesus (unrecognized)
- Pronoun: "us"
- Action: Invitation to stay
- Context: Hospitality invitation

**Algorithm Application**:
- Invitation pattern (like Rule 2.5)
- "Stay with us" = stay with the two disciples
- Jesus is invited to join "us"

**Prediction**: **INCLUSIVE**

**Reasoning**: The two disciples invite Jesus to stay WITH them. "With us" includes Jesus in the group once he accepts. Invitation to join/include.

**Confidence**: **HIGH (90%)** - Invitation pattern

**Note**: This is interesting because Jesus is invited TO the "us", becoming part of it when he accepts.

---

### NT Epistles (3 verses)

#### 10. Ephesians 2:3 - "We all once lived in passions"

**Text**: "Among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind"

**Analysis**:
- Speaker: Paul
- Addressee: Ephesian believers
- Pronoun: "we...our"
- Action: Shared past sinfulness
- Context: Doctrinal teaching on salvation

**Algorithm Application**:
- "We all" = Paul + Ephesian believers
- Shared past experience
- Rule 3.1 (Shared experience)
- Paul identifies with addressees' common history

**Prediction**: **INCLUSIVE**

**Reasoning**: Paul explicitly includes himself in shared past sinfulness ("we all"). Classic pattern of identifying with readers in common experience before salvation.

**Confidence**: **HIGH (95%)** - Very clear shared experience

---

#### 11. Philippians 3:20 - "Our citizenship is in heaven"

**Text**: "But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ"

**Analysis**:
- Speaker: Paul
- Addressee: Philippian believers
- Pronoun: "our...we"
- Action: Shared citizenship and hope
- Context: Contrast with earthly-minded people

**Algorithm Application**:
- "Our citizenship" = Paul + Philippians
- "We await" = shared hope
- Rule 3.1 (Shared identity)
- Paul identifies with addressees

**Prediction**: **INCLUSIVE**

**Reasoning**: Paul shares citizenship in heaven with the Philippian believers. Shared identity and shared eschatological hope. Classic epistle pattern of community identification.

**Confidence**: **HIGH (95%)** - Clear shared identity

---

#### 12. 1 Peter 2:24 - "That we might die to sin"

**Text**: "He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed"

**Analysis**:
- Speaker: Peter
- Addressee: Scattered believers
- Pronoun: "our...we"
- Action: Christ bore our sins, we die to sin
- Context: Teaching on Christ's sacrifice

**Algorithm Application**:
- "Our sins" = Peter + addressees
- "We might die to sin" = shared benefit of Christ's work
- Rule 3.1 (Shared experience/salvation)
- Note: Shifts to "you" at end - interesting mix

**Prediction**: **INCLUSIVE**

**Reasoning**: Peter includes himself with addressees in having sins borne by Christ and in dying to sin. Shared salvation experience. The shift to "you" at end doesn't change earlier "we/our."

**Confidence**: **HIGH (90%)** - Shared salvation experience
