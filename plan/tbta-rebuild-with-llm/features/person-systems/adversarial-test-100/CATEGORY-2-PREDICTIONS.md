# Category 2: Invitation/Exhortation - Algorithm v2.1 Blind Predictions

**Date**: 2025-11-11
**Algorithm**: v2.1 (Production)
**Verses**: 25 (Category 2 from 100-verse test set)
**Rules Tested**: 2.5a (joint action) vs 2.5b (join group)
**Status**: LOCKED PREDICTIONS (before validation)

## Key Algorithm Rules for Category 2

### Rule 2.5a: Joint Action Invitation → INCLUSIVE
```
IF invitation pattern "let us [verb]" (hortatory subjunctive)
AND action = something done TOGETHER (not joining a location)
AND speaker invites addressee to DO action jointly
THEN clusivity = INCLUSIVE (joint action)
```

### Rule 2.5b: Join Group Invitation → EXCLUSIVE
```
IF invitation contains "with us" OR "to us" (locative/accompaniment)
OR invitation to JOIN pre-existing group/location
AND speaker invites addressee FROM outside TO inside
THEN clusivity = EXCLUSIVE (pre-existing group, addressee joining)
```

**Key Semantic Distinction**:
- "Let us GO" = INCLUSIVE (go together, joint action)
- "Stay WITH us" = EXCLUSIVE (join our group, locative)

---

**Text**: "Come with me from Lebanon"
**Pattern**: "Come [with me]"
**Rule**: 2.5b (singular "me" not "us", but same principle)

**Prediction**: INCLUSIVE (for "test/examine") / EXCLUSIVE (for "lift up to God")
**Confidence**: 75%
**Reasoning**: "Let us test and examine" = joint introspection (INCLUSIVE). "Let us lift up...to God" = prayer addressed TO deity (Rule 2.1 overrides as EXCLUSIVE). Mixed clusivity in same verse.

---

**Text**: "To your tents, O Israel!"
**Pattern**: Command (not "us" construction)
**Rule**: Not applicable (no first-person plural)
**Prediction**: N/A (no clusivity marker)
**Confidence**: N/A
**Reasoning**: This is second-person command "your tents", not first-person plural. No "we/us/our" to analyze for clusivity.

---

### Verse 49: John 4:40
**Text**: "They asked him to stay with them"
**Pattern**: "Stay [with them]" (third person, not first)
**Rule**: Not applicable (third person plural, not first)
**Prediction**: N/A (but if recast as "with us", would be EXCLUSIVE)
**Confidence**: N/A
**Reasoning**: This is third-person "with them", not first-person "with us". If narrative reported as "stay with us", would be EXCLUSIVE per 2.5b.

---

### Verse 50: Luke 9:33

## Key Patterns Observed

1. **"Let us [VERB]" default to INCLUSIVE**: Strong pattern across verses 26-35, 44-47
2. **"With us/to us" default to EXCLUSIVE**: Clear pattern in verses 36, 39-41
3. **Destination doesn't override joint action**: Verses 27, 31, 44-46 show "let us go TO" patterns as INCLUSIVE
4. **Hybrid constructions exist**: Verse 37 shows both patterns in sequence
5. **Prayer override remains priority**: Verse 47b shows Rule 2.1 overriding 2.5a

---

## Potential Challenges

1. **Verse 27 (Isaiah 2:3)**: Pilgrimage with destination - could be interpreted as joining temple community
2. **Verse 38 (Proverbs 7:18)**: "Our fill" possessive complicates "let us" pattern
3. **Verse 43 (Revelation 22:17)**: Complex participatory chain - lower confidence
4. **Verse 47 (Lamentations 3:40)**: Mixed clusivity within same verse
5. **Verses 48-49**: No first-person plural markers - test set error?

---

## Validation Notes

After validation against Tagalog/Indonesian translations:
- Compare predictions against translation choices
- Look for systematic errors in destination vs. action distinction
- Examine any "let us" patterns that validate as EXCLUSIVE
- Check if "our" possessive affects clusivity in verse 38
