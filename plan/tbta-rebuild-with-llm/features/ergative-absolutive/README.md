# Ergative-Absolutive Alignment

**Status:** Documentation complete
**TBTA Relevance:** High - affects Mayan (22 langs), Trans-New Guinea (many langs), Indo-Iranian (Hindi/Urdu/Marathi)
**Greek/Hebrew:** Nominative-accusative alignment (subjects treated alike, objects marked)

## Overview

Ergative-absolutive alignment is a grammatical system where:
- **Absolutive case:** Marks intransitive subjects (S) AND transitive objects (O) alike
- **Ergative case:** Marks only transitive subjects (A - agents)

This differs fundamentally from Greek/Hebrew nominative-accusative systems where:
- **Nominative case:** Marks all subjects (both S and A)
- **Accusative case:** Marks only objects (O)

## Comparison: Ergative vs Nominative-Accusative

### Nominative-Accusative (Greek/Hebrew/English)
- **Intransitive:** "Jesus-**NOM** wept"
- **Transitive:** "Jesus-**NOM** healed the man-**ACC**"
- Pattern: S=A (subjects treated alike), O marked differently

### Ergative-Absolutive (Mayan/TNG/Hindi past)
- **Intransitive:** "Jesus-**ABS** wept"
- **Transitive:** "Jesus-**ERG** healed the man-**ABS**"
- Pattern: S=O (intransitive subject = object), A marked differently

## Key Implication

**In ergative languages:**
- Intransitive subjects are marked like objects (not like agents)
- Transitive subjects (agents) receive special marking
- This creates **different emphasis patterns** than Greek/Hebrew

## Cross-Linguistic Patterns

### Pure Ergative-Absolutive
**Mayan languages (all 22):**
- Ergative marks transitive agents
- Absolutive marks intransitive subjects and objects
- Consistent across all contexts

### Split Ergativity
**Common pattern:** Ergativity splits based on:
1. **Tense/aspect split** (Hindi/Urdu/Marathi)
2. **Noun type split** (pronouns vs nouns - Trans-New Guinea)
3. **Optional ergativity** (Dani, Yali)

## Language Family Examples

### Mayan (K'iche' - pure ergative)
**Transitive:**
```
x-∅-atz'ub-a-n      ri Xwan ri li tz'i'-a
PERF-ABS.3SG-bite-TV-ABS.3PL  ART Xwan ART DEF dog-ABS
"Xwan bit the dog"
```
- Xwan (agent) = ergative marking
- Dog (patient) = absolutive marking

**Intransitive:**
```
x-r-aj-tik          ri ala
PERF-ERG.3SG-go-PL  ART child
"The child went"
```
- Child (intransitive subject) = absolutive-like treatment

### Indo-Iranian (Hindi - split ergative)

**Imperfective (NOM-ACC):**
```
लड़का रोटी खाता है
laṛkā    roṭī    khātā    hai
boy.NOM  bread.NOM  eats     is
"The boy eats bread"
```
- Nominative-accusative alignment (no ergative)

**Perfective (ERG-ABS):**
```
लड़के ने रोटी खाई
laṛke  ne    roṭī    khāī
boy.ERG  ERG   bread.ABS  ate
"The boy ate bread"
```
- Ergative marking (ने) on agent
- Absolutive (unmarked) on patient
- **Only in perfective aspects!**

### Trans-New Guinea (variable)
**Split systems common:**
- Nouns: Ergative-absolutive
- Pronouns: Nominative-accusative
- Or: Ergative optional based on disambiguation

**Dani example:** Ergative only when needed for clarity

## Biblical Translation Examples

### Active Constructions
**John 1:1 - "In the beginning was the Word"**
- Greek: ἦν ὁ λόγος (was the Word-NOM)
- Intransitive verb "was"
- **Ergative language:** Word-**ABS** (treated like object, not agent)

**Mark 1:9 - "Jesus came and was baptized"**
- Greek: ἦλθεν Ἰησοῦς (came Jesus-NOM)
- Intransitive verb "came"
- **Ergative language:** Jesus-**ABS** (absolutive marking)

**Mark 1:41 - "Jesus healed the man"**
- Greek: (implicit transitive construction)
- Transitive verb "healed"
- **Ergative language:** Jesus-**ERG**, man-**ABS**
- Agent de-emphasized grammatically; patient highlighted

### Passive Constructions
**Greek passive may map naturally to ergative:**
- **Matthew 1:20** "What is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit"
- Greek passive construction
- Ergative: Can use absolutive marking (patient-focused)

### Hindi/Urdu Perfective Split
**Narrative (perfective aspects):**
- All narrative mainline events: ERG-ABS alignment
- "Jesus-ERG healed, taught, spoke"

**Ongoing/habitual (imperfective):**
- NOM-ACC alignment (like Greek)
- "Jesus teaches, loves, knows"

## Theological Implications

### Agent De-Emphasis
**Ergative construction highlights action/patient more than agent:**
- "God-ERG created the world-ABS"
- Grammatically emphasizes "world" (absolutive) not "God" (marked ergative)
- Different nuance than Greek "God-NOM created"

### Divine Action Emphasis
**Patient-focused theology:**
- Ergative naturally emphasizes what God does TO/FOR humans
- Patients of divine action grammatically highlighted
- "We-ABS are saved" (absolutive = patient of salvation)

### Reflexive Constructions
**"He humbled himself" (Philippians 2:8):**
- Ergative marker often deleted in reflexives
- Self-action treated specially
- May affect how voluntary submission is expressed

### Causative Constructions
**"God made them" (Genesis 1:27):**
- Complex ergative marking
- Causee may receive special case
- Interaction with transitivity

## Cultural Variations

### Emphasis Patterns
**What gets highlighted:**
- Ergative systems: Patient/result is prominent
- Nominative systems: Agent is prominent
- Affects how divine action is perceived

### Theological Nuance
**"Faith of Christ" vs "Faith in Christ" (Galatians 2:16):**
- Greek genitive ambiguous
- Ergative marking could clarify:
  - If Christ is agent of faith → Ergative
  - If Christ is object of faith → Absolutive

### Passive Theology
**"We are saved" - passive voice:**
- Absolutive marking natural (we are patients)
- Emphasizes God's action on us
- Less emphasis on our agency

## Split Ergativity Challenges

### Hindi/Urdu/Marathi Pattern
**Perfective = Ergative:**
- All completed biblical events
- Most narrative
- Historical facts

**Imperfective = Nominative-Accusative:**
- Eternal truths
- Ongoing states
- Habitual actions

**Translation impact:**
- Aspect choice affects case marking
- Theological statements: "God loves the world" = imperfective (no ergative)
- Historical events: "Christ died for sins" = perfective (ergative)

### Pronoun vs Noun Splits (Trans-New Guinea)
**Some languages:**
- Nouns use ergative-absolutive
- Pronouns use nominative-accusative
- Mixed systems within single sentence

**Translation complexity:**
- Different strategies for divine names vs pronouns
- "God-ERG healed" but "He-NOM healed" (same referent!)

### Optional Ergativity (Dani, Yali)
**Ergative marking optional:**
- Used for disambiguation
- Used for emphasis
- Discourse-level considerations

**Translation decisions:**
- When to use ergative marking?
- Does emphasis in Greek/Hebrew warrant ergative?
- How does community use optional ergative in discourse?

## Interaction with Other TBTA Features

### With Voice (Active/Passive)
- Greek passive may map to ergative absolutive constructions
- Patient-focus of passive aligns with ergative emphasis

### With Semantic Roles
- Ergative languages grammaticalize agent/patient distinction
- TBTA semantic role annotation especially critical

### With Aspect (Hindi/Urdu split)
- Aspect choice determines case alignment
- TBTA aspect annotation affects case marking

### With Participant Tracking
- Ergative marking helps track agents
- Absolutive marking tracks patients and intransitive subjects

## Data Requirements for TBTA

### Per-Verb Annotation
For each verb, annotate:
1. **Transitivity:** Transitive or intransitive?
2. **Agent/patient roles:** Who does what to whom?
3. **Semantic role:** Agent, patient, experiencer, etc.
4. **Voice:** Active, passive, middle?

### Language-Specific Documentation
For each ergative language:
- Pure ergative or split?
- If split: What triggers split (aspect, noun type, etc.)?
- Is ergative optional or obligatory?
- How does ergative interact with voice?
- Cultural preferences for ergative use?

### Theological Significance
Document theologically significant verbs:
- How does ergative marking affect meaning?
- Agent de-emphasis appropriate or not?
- Cultural perception of agent/patient prominence

## Variants by Family

### Mayan (22 languages - all ergative)
**Pure ergative-absolutive:**
- All 22 languages
- Defining family feature
- Ergative prefixes mark agents
- Absolutive suffixes mark patients/intransitive subjects

### Indo-Iranian (Western Indo-Aryan only)
**Split ergativity:**
- Hindi, Urdu, Marathi, Gujarati
- Perfective = ergative
- Imperfective = nominative-accusative
- Unique in Indo-European family

### Trans-New Guinea (variable)
**Common but variable:**
- Many languages have ergative-absolutive
- Often split-ergative:
  - Nouns vs pronouns
  - Optional vs obligatory
  - Discourse-conditioned
- Some languages: nominative-accusative

### Other Languages
**Basque, Georgian, some Australian, some Caucasian:**
- Not in current Bible translation dataset focus
- But same principles apply

## Research Gaps

1. How do ergative languages translate Greek/Hebrew nominative-accusative patterns?
2. Does patient-focus affect theological interpretation?
3. How do split-ergative languages map Greek aspect to case alignment?
4. What discourse factors trigger optional ergative?
5. Do Christianized ergative communities develop theological preferences for case use?

## Recommendations

### For TBTA Annotation
1. **Mark transitivity of all verbs**
   - Crucial for ergative languages
   - Indicates case marking pattern

2. **Annotate semantic roles clearly**
   - Agent, patient, experiencer, etc.
   - Ergative languages grammaticalize these

3. **Flag theologically significant agent/patient relationships**
   - Divine agency
   - Human passivity in salvation
   - Reflexive actions

### For Tool Development
1. **Automatic transitivity detection**
   - Based on Greek/Hebrew verb valency
   - With overrides for context

2. **Ergative mapping predictor**
   - For split-ergative languages: map aspect to alignment
   - For optional ergative: suggest discourse factors

3. **Theological notes**
   - How does ergative marking affect meaning?
   - Community preferences for significant passages

### For Translation Practice
1. **Understand target language alignment**
   - Pure or split ergative?
   - What triggers splits?

2. **Don't assume source language patterns**
   - Ergative is not "backward" nominative
   - Different emphasis, not wrong emphasis

3. **Leverage ergative for natural expression**
   - Patient-focus can be theologically rich
   - "We are saved" (absolutive) emphasizes God's action on us

4. **For split systems:**
   - Map aspect carefully
   - Hindi perfective = most narrative
   - Aspect choice affects case alignment
