# Defining Linguistic Features of Niger-Congo

## 1. Noun Class Systems

### Overview
The noun class system is the most characteristic feature of Niger-Congo languages (Britannica; Oxford Bibliographies). It functions as a gender system with multiple genders, typically ranging from 3 to 25 classes depending on the language.

### Key Characteristics

- Nouns grouped into classes marked by affixes (prefixes, suffixes, or both)
- Each class has distinct singular and plural markers
- Proto-Bantu had 19 noun classes (Meinhof classification identifies 22 total) [NEEDS SOURCE: Meinhof classification]
- Atlantic languages: 3-25 classes
- Gur languages: typically 11 classes
- Bantu languages: 10-21 classes (Ganda retains 21)

### Concord/Agreement System

Most noun class systems include accompanying concord: determiners, adjectives, quantifiers, and frequently verbs are marked with affixes that agree with the noun's class (Britannica; Hyman et al. 2019).

**Example from Research:**
In Bantu languages, "the class is indicated by a prefix that is part of the noun, as well as agreement markers on verb and qualificative roots connected with the noun" (Wikipedia: Bantu languages).

### Exceptions

- **Mande languages**: Completely lack noun class systems (Dimmendaal 2008; Blench)
- **Kru languages**: Only remnants remain in some languages, using suffixes instead of prefixes
- **Ijoid languages**: Lack even traces of noun class systems

### Directionality Variation

- Most Niger-Congo: Prefixes (especially Bantu, Atlantic-Congo)
- Gur languages: Suffixes
- Adamawa-Ubangi: Suffixes

### Semantic Basis

While often called "gender," Niger-Congo noun classes are primarily semantic/nominal classifications not dependent on biological gender. Common semantic groupings include humans, animals, plants, tools, abstract concepts, and locatives. [NEEDS SOURCE for semantic groupings]

### Bible Translation Impact

Translators must assign God and biblical figures to appropriate noun classes, affecting all agreement patterns throughout the text. The choice of class carries semantic/cultural implications.

## 2. Verbal Systems: Tense, Aspect, and Modality

### Aspect Predominance

Niger-Congo languages originally had only aspectual contrasts, not tense. Tenses emerged later and in some branches are still emerging (Nurse & Devos: "Tense and Aspect in Niger-Congo").

### Five Widespread Aspects

1. **Factative (FAC)/Perfective (PFV)**: Completed action
2. **Imperfective (IPFV)**: Ongoing, habitual, or incomplete action
3. **Perfect (PFT)**: Completed action with present relevance
4. **Progressive (PRG)**: Ongoing action at reference time
5. **Habitual (HAB)/Iterative**: Repeated or customary action

### Sub-family Patterns

#### Kwa Languages
- Aspect and modality prominent over tense
- Little to no grammatical tense marking
- Perfective vs. imperfective primary distinction
- Prefixes predominantly mark verbal categories

#### Gur Languages
- Imperfective/perfective contrast
- Main tense distinctions: past/non-past and future/non-future
- Aspect conveyed by verbal extensions

#### Bantu Languages
- Verbal elements conflated to mark tense and aspect
- Morphemes often inseparable
- Rich set of tense-aspect distinctions
- Highly complex verb conjugation system

#### Adamawa-Ubangi
- Primary contrast: perfective vs. imperfective

### Bible Translation Impact

Biblical Greek and Hebrew tense/aspect systems do not map directly onto Niger-Congo aspectual systems. Translators must make exegetical decisions about whether events are completed, ongoing, habitual, etc., as these are obligatory grammatical categories in the receptor language.

As noted in research: "In Bantu languages, the verbal element is characteristically conflated to mark tense and aspect and more often than not, the morphemes marking tense and aspect cannot be isolated" (Academia.edu: Tense, Aspect and Case in Bantu).

## 3. Serial Verb Constructions (SVCs)

### Definition

Multiple verbs share the same subject and tense/aspect/polarity features, appearing in sequence without conjunctions or markers of coordination/subordination (Britannica; Niger-Congo sources).

### Key Characteristics

- Single tense node with two or more verbs
- Tense-aspect markers occur once and scope over entire series
- Unity of subject across all verbs
- Unity of TAM (tense-aspect-modality)
- Unity of negation
- No overt marker of syntactic relation

### Distribution

SVCs are an areal feature of West African languages, particularly:
- Kwa languages (extensively documented)
- Benue-Congo languages
- Gur languages
- Kordofanian languages
- Mande languages
- Atlantic languages
- Ijoid languages

### Example from Kwa

In Akan and other Kwa languages, SVCs are prominent morphosyntactic structures allowing complex event descriptions through verb sequencing. [NEEDS SOURCE: specific example]

### Bible Translation Impact

Biblical texts often contain complex event sequences that may be naturally expressed through SVCs in Niger-Congo languages, or conversely, source texts with simpler structures may need to be expressed with SVCs to sound natural.

## 4. Person Marking and Pronoun Systems

### Subject Indexation

In many Niger-Congo languages, finite verb forms include obligatory subject indices analyzable as agreement markers. This is common in some language groups but less common in others (Oxford Research Encyclopedia: Morphology in Niger-Congo).

### Object Marking

No Niger-Congo language has obligatory object indexation with all object types. When present, it's restricted to:
- Topical objects
- Specific semantic types (definite, human)

### Gender in Pronouns

"Within humans, no grammatical distinction between male and female referents that could give rise to masculine and feminine genders is made in many Niger-Congo languages" (WALS: Gender Distinctions in Independent Personal Pronouns).

In third person, pronouns/agreement markers either:
- Encode the gender (noun class) of the referent noun
- Simply encode person and number

### Babaev (2013)

Detailed survey of pronouns in Niger-Congo languages with reconstructions (cited in Proto-Niger-Congo Wikipedia).

### Bible Translation Impact

Biblical languages (Hebrew, Greek, English) use gendered pronouns extensively. Many Niger-Congo languages lack grammatical gender distinctions in personal pronouns, creating challenges for translating references to God, Jesus, and human characters where gender is significant in the source text.

## 5. Tonal Systems

### Prevalence

Most Niger-Congo languages are tonal, using pitch to make lexical and grammatical distinctions (Britannica; multiple sources).

### Tone Levels

- Typically 2-3 tones
- Some languages have 4-5 tones
- Gur languages: usually 2-4 tones
- Kwa languages: 2-5 tones
- Adamawa-Ubangi: 2-4 contrastive tones
- Kru languages: 3-4 tone levels

### Notable Exceptions (Non-tonal)

- **Swahili** (Bantu)
- **Fula/Fulfulde** (Atlantic)
- **Wolof** (Atlantic - has pitch-accent system instead)

### Grammatical Functions

Tone serves multiple functions:
- Lexical distinctions (different words)
- Grammatical marking (tense/aspect in verbs)
- Definiteness/indefiniteness marking
- Singular/plural distinctions
- Imperfective/perfective distinctions (especially Kru)

### Bible Translation Impact

Tone must be marked correctly in written translations for comprehension. Tonal errors can change meaning entirely, creating theological problems. Many early Bible translations in African languages lacked proper tone marking, leading to ambiguity or incorrect readings. [NEEDS SOURCE: "many early Bible translations..."]

## 6. Phonological Features

### Vowel Systems

#### Vowel Harmony

"Vowels fall into two sets, and in any one word, only vowels from one set may occur" (Britannica; multiple sources).

#### Advanced Tongue Root (ATR)

- Kwa languages: Vowel harmony contrasts advanced vs. retracted tongue root
- Kru languages: Typical system has 4 front, 4 back, 1 central vowel with +ATR/-ATR contrast
- Adamawa-Ubangi: Partial vowel harmony with co-occurrence restrictions

#### Common Systems

- Adamawa-Ubangi: 5 or 7 vowel systems predominate
- Gur: Vowel length contrast widespread
- Yoruba: 7 oral vowels, 5 nasal vowels
- Swahili: 5 vowels

#### Nasal Vowels

Many Niger-Congo languages distinguish oral and nasal vowels (Yoruba, Proto-Ijo descendants).

### Consonant Features

#### Labio-velar Consonants

- Kwa languages: kp (voiceless), gb (voiced) in Ga-Dangme, Central Togo, Gbe
- Gur languages: Stops/fricatives at 5 points (labial, alveolar, palatal, velar, labiovelar)

#### Implosive Consonants

- Wolof: Implosive consonants (mb, nd) less common globally

#### Prenasalized Stops

- Adamawa-Ubangi: Prenasalized stops and fricatives common

#### Syllabic Nasals

- Gur: Widespread occurrence of syllabic nasals carrying tone and syllabic timing, appearing word-initially

#### Consonant Mutation

- Atlantic/Senegambian: Initial consonant changes based on morphological/syntactic environment
- Fula: Initial consonant alternations between singular and plural

#### Closed Syllables

- Fula: Closed syllable structure (unusual for Niger-Congo)

### Bible Translation Impact

Proper orthographic representation of these phonological features is crucial. Decisions about how to represent labio-velars, implosives, tone, and vowel distinctions affect readability and comprehension.

## 7. Morphological Typology

### Overall Pattern

Niger-Congo morphosyntactic typology is diverse:
- **Agglutinating**: Northwest (Atlantic) and southern (Bantu) regions
- **Isolating**: Central areas
- **Mixed**: Varies by sub-family

### Bantu (Agglutinating)

"All Bantu languages are agglutinative" with "extensive use of affixes" (Wikipedia: Bantu languages).

**Features:**
- Rich derivative affix systems
- Balanced symmetrical vowel systems
- Distinctive tone
- Wide variety of derivative affixes

#### Bantu Verb Extensions (Derivational Suffixes)

- **Causative** (typically -is- or -y-): Makes someone/something do the action
- **Applicative** (typically -il- or -el-): Adds beneficiary or other participant
- **Reciprocal** (typically -an-): Indicates mutual action
- **Passive** (typically -w-): Converts object to subject position

These can combine in specific orders to create complex derived forms.

### Mande (Isolating/Analytic)

"Highly analytic compared to the synthesis found in the verbal and nominal morphology of Atlantic" (PDXScholar). [NEEDS SOURCE: specific PDXScholar citation]

### Atlantic (Synthetic)

Rich verbal and nominal morphology; more synthetic than Mande.

### Bible Translation Impact

Agglutinating languages can express in a single word what English or Greek expresses in multiple words. Translators must decide whether to preserve multi-word constructions or use natural single-word forms, affecting translation philosophy (formal vs. functional equivalence).

## 8. Syntactic Features

### Word Order

#### Predominant: SVO (Subject-Verb-Object)

- Kwa languages: SVO, head-initial
- Bantu languages: SVO
- Benue-Congo: SVO
- Adamawa-Ubangi: SVO

#### Notable Exceptions

- **Ijoid languages**: SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) - highly unusual for Niger-Congo
- **Mande languages**: Debated, often SOV tendencies
- **Some Gur languages**: VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) - relatively rare globally
- **Kru languages**: Primarily SVO but can also be SOV

### Noun Phrase Structure

#### Kwa Languages

Head-initial; noun modifiers (adjectives, articles) follow the noun.

#### Possession

In Adamawa-Ubangi: Possessed precedes possessor (language-wide pattern).

### Bible Translation Impact

Word order differences affect natural flow of translated text. Languages with flexible word order may use different orders for emphasis or information structure, allowing translators some freedom in rendering biblical emphasis patterns.
