# Sub-family Specific Characteristics

## Bantu Languages

### Overview

**Size**: 350 million speakers (2015); largest sub-group

### Diagnostic Features

- Agglutinative morphology
- 10-21 noun classes with prefixes
- Rich verb conjugation with extensions (causative, applicative, reciprocal, passive)
- SVO word order
- Tonal (except Swahili)
- Symmetrical vowel systems

### Bible Translation Challenges (Doke 1958; Research)

1. **Locative Usage**: Use of locative forms (ku-, go-, eka-) in biblical contexts questionable; normally indicate motion, not static location ("in"). These forms aren't used with this meaning outside the Bible. [NEEDS SOURCE: verification of usage outside Bible]

2. **Idiomatic Expression**: Literal translations create awkwardness. Example: "our ancestor according to the flesh" should use Bantu idiom "of the same blood." [NEEDS SOURCE: specific language example]

3. **Tense/Aspect Conflation**: Verbal morphemes marking tense and aspect are inseparable, creating challenges when translating Greek aorist, perfect, imperfect, etc.

4. **Noun Class Assignment**: Must place God, Jesus, biblical figures in appropriate noun classes, affecting all concordial agreement throughout text.

5. **Literal vs. Meaning-Based Inconsistency**: Southern African translations inconsistent, sometimes meaning-based, sometimes literal, distorting meaning. [NEEDS SOURCE: specific examples]

6. **Gender/Pronoun Decisions**: Languages without grammatical gender pronouns must find equivalents for gendered biblical language.

### Key Bantu Languages in Dataset

- **Swahili**: Widest reach; non-tonal (unusual); 15 noun classes
- **Ganda**: Retains 21 noun classes (highest documented)
- **Chichewa**: Significant for Malawi Bible translation work

## Atlantic (West Atlantic/Senegambian) Languages

### Overview

**Size**: Smaller than Bantu, geographically West Africa (Senegal, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau) [NEEDS SOURCE: speaker numbers]

### Diagnostic Features

- **Largely non-tonal** (major divergence from Niger-Congo pattern)
- **Consonant mutation**: Initial consonant changes based on environment
- Noun class systems with 3-25 classes
- Some have pitch-accent (Wolof)
- Similar to Bantu classes but distant relationship

### Wolof-Specific

- Non-tonal (pitch-accent)
- **Unique verb system**: Verbs are unchangeable stems that cannot be conjugated; personal pronouns conjugate instead
- 8 singular class markers, 2 plural
- Rich nasal sounds, implosive consonants (mb, nd)

### Fula/Fulfulde-Specific

- Non-tonal
- Closed syllable structure
- Nonproductive compound morphology [NEEDS SOURCE: clarification]
- Extensive nominal classes
- Initial consonant alternation between singular/plural

### Bible Translation Challenges

1. Consonant mutation must be correctly applied in all morphological environments.
2. Wolof's pronoun conjugation system requires different translation approaches to verbal ideas.
3. Non-tonal writing systems simpler but must represent pitch-accent where relevant.

## Gur (Voltaic) Languages

### Overview

**Size**: Substantial group; West Africa (Burkina Faso, Ghana, Togo, Benin) [NEEDS SOURCE: speaker numbers]

### Diagnostic Features

- **All are tonal** (2-4 tones)
- **Noun class suffixes** (contrasts with Niger-Congo preference for prefixes)
- Syllabic nasals (widespread, word-initial, carry tone)
- Stops/fricatives at 5 articulation points
- Vowel length contrast widespread
- Vowel harmony in Grusi languages

### Verbal System

- Imperfective/perfective contrast
- Tense: past/non-past, future/non-future
- Aspect conveyed by verbal extensions

### Syntax

- **Some languages: VSO word order** (relatively rare globally)

### Bible Translation Challenges

1. Suffix-based noun class agreement affects translation decisions differently than prefix systems.
2. VSO word order requires careful attention to natural information flow.
3. Syllabic nasals must be properly represented orthographically.

## Kwa Languages

### Overview

**Size**: ~50 languages, 25 million speakers; southeastern Ivory Coast, southern Ghana, central Togo [NEEDS SOURCE: verify numbers]

**Major Languages**: Ewe, Akan, Baule

### Diagnostic Features

- Vowel harmony (advanced vs. retracted tongue root)
- 2-5 tones (lexical and grammatical)
- Labio-velar consonants (kp, gb) in some languages
- **SVO word order; head-initial**
- **Serial verb constructions prominent**

### Verbal System

- **Aspect and modality more central than tense**
- Perfective vs. imperfective primary distinction
- Prefixes predominantly mark verbal categories (suffixes rare)

### Information Structure

Dedicated structural positions and morphological markers for information status (Akye, Akan, Ewe, Ga, Likpe, Yoruba). [NEEDS SOURCE: specific citation]

### Bible Translation Challenges

1. Serial verb constructions must be used appropriately to sound natural.
2. Aspect-prominent system requires careful analysis of source text events.
3. Information structure devices may be used to preserve biblical emphasis patterns.

## Mande Languages

### Overview

**Size**: Variable speaker population; western West Africa [NEEDS SOURCE: specific numbers]

### Diagnostic Features

- **LACKS noun class system** (major divergence; questions Niger-Congo membership)
- **Highly analytic/isolating** morphology (contrasts with Atlantic/Bantu synthesis)
- Tonal
- Some SOV tendencies

### Classification Debate

- **Dimmendaal (2008)**: Evidence for Niger-Congo inclusion slim; best considered independent
- **Blench**: Early branch that diverged before noun-class morphology developed
- **Güldemann (2018)**: Lacks sufficient lexical and noun class resemblances
- **Glottolog**: Considers Mande potentially independent

### Languages in Dataset

- Sénoufo cluster (Mamara, Supyire) - Mali
- Maninka, Sankaran - Guinea
- Toma - Guinea

### Bible Translation Challenges

1. Absence of noun classes simplifies some agreement issues but lacks the semantic categorization other Niger-Congo languages use.
2. Isolating morphology may require more function words than source texts.
3. If Mande is not truly Niger-Congo, translation strategies developed for Niger-Congo may not apply.

## Benue-Congo (Non-Bantu)

### Overview

**Size**: Massive sub-family including Bantu; non-Bantu members include major languages

### Major Sub-groups in Dataset

- **Defoid**: Yoruba (largest L1 Niger-Congo language by speakers) [NEEDS SOURCE: verify]
- **Igboid**: Ika, Ikwere (southeastern Nigeria, 20M+ speakers) [NEEDS SOURCE: verify speaker numbers]
- **Edoid**: Ivbie North-Okpela-Arhe
- **Cross River**: Various
- **Nupoid**: Bisã, Tsikimba, Ninzo

### Diagnostic Features

- Noun class systems with prefixes
- Concordial agreement
- Tonal
- SVO word order
- Rich verbal morphology

### Yoruba-Specific

- Niger-Congo language with largest L1 speaker population [NEEDS SOURCE: verify]
- 7 oral vowels, 5 nasal vowels
- Extensively documented; important for West African Christianity

### Igboid-Specific

- 50+ dialects grouped into 7 clusters [NEEDS SOURCE: verify numbers]
- Standard written form slow to develop, now emerging (Owerri/Umuahia-based) [NEEDS SOURCE]

### Bible Translation Challenges

Similar to Bantu but with regional variations. Yoruba's large speaker base and documentation make it influential in West African translation theory.

## Adamawa-Ubangi Languages

### Overview

**Size**: Northeastern Nigeria, Central African Republic, Cameroon [NEEDS SOURCE: speaker numbers]

### Diagnostic Features

- 5 or 7 vowel systems
- Partial vowel harmony
- 2-4 contrastive tones
- **Noun class suffixes** (not prefixes)
- Prenasalized stops and fricatives common
- Perfective/imperfective verb contrast
- SVO word order
- Possessed precedes possessor

### Consonant Variation

- **Adamawa**: Limited intervocalic/final consonants (nasals, stops, one lateral)
- **Ubangi**: Full consonant range in all positions

### Bible Translation Challenges

1. Suffix-based noun classes require different agreement strategies than prefix systems.
2. Vowel harmony must be maintained in translation.

## Kru Languages

### Overview

**Size**: ~24 languages, 3 million speakers; southwestern Côte d'Ivoire, southern Liberia [NEEDS SOURCE: verify numbers]

**Classification Status**: Disputed Niger-Congo membership

### Diagnostic Features

- **Only remnants of noun class system** (suffixes, not prefixes)
- 3-4 tone levels (lexical and grammatical)
- Tone distinguishes imperfective/perfective, definite/indefinite, singular/plural
- 4 front vowels, 4 back, 1 central with +ATR/-ATR contrast
- **Flexible word order: SVO or SOV**
- Aspect-based verbal system (imperfective/perfective suffixes)

### Classification Debate

- **Güldemann (2018)**: Lacks sufficient lexical and noun class resemblances to Niger-Congo
- **Glottolog**: Considers Kru independent family

### Bible Translation Challenges

1. If not Niger-Congo, translation strategies need independent development.
2. Flexible word order offers translation freedom but requires understanding natural patterns.
3. Tonal marking of grammatical distinctions crucial for comprehension.

## Ijoid Languages

### Overview

**Size**: Small group; Niger Delta of Nigeria

**Major Language**: Ijaw (Ịjọ), plus endangered Defaka

**Classification Status**: Disputed Niger-Congo membership

### Diagnostic Features

- **SOV word order** (highly unusual for Niger-Congo; shared only with Mande, Dogon)
- **Lacks noun class system** (no traces)
- Tonal (multiple levels; tone has grammatical functions)
- Serial verb constructions
- Nasal vowels (Proto-Ijo: 9 oral vowels, descendants: 5-7) [NEEDS SOURCE: verify vowel numbers]

### Classification Debate

- **Dimmendaal & Güldemann**: Doubt Niger-Congo membership; likely independent family
- Early split or separate family

### Bible Translation Challenges

1. SOV word order requires careful attention to natural phrase ordering.
2. Lack of noun classes simplifies some issues but lacks semantic categorization.
3. Serial verb constructions must be used naturally.
