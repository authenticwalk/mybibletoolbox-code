## 1. Verb Systems: The Core of TNG Grammar

### 1.1 Medial vs. Final Verbs (Clause Chaining)

**Definition**: One of the most distinctive features of TNG languages is the distinction between medial and final verbs in clause chains.

**Characteristics**:
- **Medial verbs**: Mark co-reference or disjoint reference of participants (switch-reference)
- **Final verbs**: Mark tense, mood, aspect, and illocutionary force
- Medial verbs often cannot be marked for full TAM categories
- Medial and final verbs have formally and functionally distinct markers

**Functional significance**:
- This tracking system maintains discourse continuity
- Highly characteristic of TNG, less common in other language families worldwide
- Creates long verb chains describing sequential events

**Translation implications**:
- Biblical narrative with sequential actions maps well to clause chains
- Care needed in translating Greek/Hebrew coordinate clauses
- May require restructuring to preserve natural discourse flow

**Examples**:
- Usan, Nungon, Ku Waru, Mian, Telefol all exhibit elaborate clause chaining
- Chains can extend for many clauses before reaching a final verb

### 1.2 Switch-Reference Systems

**Definition**: Morphological marking on medial verbs indicating whether the subject of the next clause is the same or different.

**Categories**:
- **Same-subject (SS)**: Next clause has same subject
- **Different-subject (DS)**: Next clause has different subject
- Some languages have more elaborate systems tracking multiple participants

**Translation implications**:
- Essential for maintaining participant reference in narrative
- Greek participles and conjunctions may need restructuring
- Important for translating Old Testament historical narratives
- Crucial for Gospel narratives with multiple participants interacting

**Example** (from Usan quotatives):
- *qamb* (say.SS) marks "same subject" continuation
- Used for indirect speech and "inner speech" constructions

**Source**: Reesink, Ger P. "Usan quotatives."

### 1.3 Person Marking Patterns

**Diagnostic feature**: Subject-Object-Verb order with:
- **Object marking**: Verbal prefixes (n- for 1sg, velar stop for 2sg)
- **Subject marking**: Verbal suffixes
- Pattern: Object-prefix + Verb-root + Subject-suffix

**Alignment**:
- Verbal morphology typically follows **nominative-accusative** alignment
- This contrasts with ergative case marking (see section 3 below)

**Examples from languages**:
- Mian: triple-indexing (subject suffixes, object prefixes, recipient suffixes), head-marking
- Telefol: triple-indexing (same pattern as Mian), head-marking
- Fuyug: simpler morphology compared to highland languages
- Kimaghama: isolating morphology (minimal inflection)

**Translation implications**:
- Greek and Hebrew person marking in verbs maps reasonably well
- Pronominal reference in translations needs careful attention
- Dual number in pronouns affects rendering of "both" or paired individuals

## 2. Word Order

**Basic pattern**: **Subject-Object-Verb (SOV)**
- Typologically consistent across the family
- Postpositions rather than prepositions (e.g., "town in" not "in town")
- Some languages allow relatively free word order for discourse purposes

**Translation implications**:
- Opposite of Greek/Hebrew VSO/SVO patterns
- May require complete clause restructuring
- Postpositional phrases rather than prepositional phrases
- Relative clauses typically precede head nouns

## 3. Case Systems

### 3.1 Ergative-Absolutive Alignment

**Pattern**: While verbal morphology is typically nominative-accusative, **case marking on nouns** commonly follows **ergative-absolutive** patterns.

**Categories**:
- **Ergative**: Marks transitive subject (agent)
- **Absolutive**: Marks intransitive subject and transitive object
- Often unmarked forms for absolutive

**Source**: WALS Chapter 98: "Alignment of Case Marking of Full Noun Phrases"

### 3.2 Optional Ergativity

**Key finding**: Many TNG languages show **optional ergative marking** dependent on:
- **Animacy**: More animate subjects more likely to take ergative
- **Agentivity**: More agentive/volitional actions trigger ergative
- **Focus**: Focused or contrastive subjects take ergative
- **Disambiguation**: Ergative used to avoid ambiguity

**Examples**:
- Lower Grand Valley Dani: ergative primarily for disambiguation
- Yali: optional ergative interacts with discourse prominence at both global and local levels
- Kaluli, Ku Waru, Duna: studied for acquisition of ergative marking
- Kobon: No case on full nouns, but pronominal case exists (additive-quantitatively asymmetrical system)

**Translation implications**:
- Greek/Hebrew don't have ergative systems
- Agent/patient relations may need explicit marking
- Transitive/intransitive verb pairs may affect translation choices
- Important for causative constructions

## 4. Number Systems

**Typical distinctions**:
- **Singular**
- **Dual** (two) - very common in TNG
- **Plural** (three or more)
- **Paucal** (few) - rare, e.g., Yimas has four-way system: sg/dual/paucal/pl

**Proto-TNG reconstructions**:
- Dual: *-li, *-t
- Plural: *-nV
- Collective: *-pi- (dual), *-m- (plural)

**Distribution**:
- Number often marked on verbs rather than (or in addition to) nouns
- Some languages (like Amele) restrict number marking to kinship terms
- Many languages have minimal or optional number marking on nouns

**Translation implications**:
- Dual number very significant for pairs in Scripture (two disciples, two witnesses, etc.)
- Hebrew dual forms may map directly to TNG dual
- "Both" and "all" require careful distinction
- Collective plurals may affect rendering of group nouns

**Examples**:
- Yimas: four-way number distinction (singular, dual, paucal, plural) in pronouns
- Wantoat: three-way distinction (singular, dual, plural) in pronouns
- Amele: number marking (plural -el) restricted to kinship terms

## 5. Serial Verb Constructions

**Prevalence**: Extremely common and productive in TNG languages

**Function**: Compensate for small verb root inventories
- Many TNG languages have limited verb root inventories
- Serial verbs expand expressive capacity

**Types**:

1. **Causative serialization**: Using 'get' or similar verb
   - Common pattern across TNG languages

2. **Benefactive/applicative**: Using 'give' or similar
   - Benefactives typically require serial construction with 'give'

3. **Aspectual**: Grammaticalized aspect marking
   - Progressive from 'stay'
   - Completive from 'finish'

4. **Directional**: Motion verbs in series

**Translation implications**:
- Greek compound verbs may map to serial constructions
- Benefactive constructions ("for someone") require verb serialization
- Causatives need serial verb structures
- Important for translating complex events as verb sequences

**Example**: Kalam has been extensively studied for its serial verb constructions evolving from event sequences to grammatical markers

**Source**: Pawley, Andrew & Jonathan Lane. 1998. "From event sequence to grammar: Serial verb constructions in Kalam." In *Discourse and cognition: Bridging the gap*, 201-227. Stanford: CSLI Publications.

## 6. Tense, Aspect, and Mood (TAM) Systems

### 6.1 Obligatory TAM Marking

- **Trans-New Guinea languages**: Show high rates of obligatory TAM marking compared to other language families in the region
- TAM marking is a characteristic feature of TNG languages, particularly in larger sub-families

### 6.2 Tense Systems

**Multiple past tense distinctions** are extremely common:

**Examples**:

**Amele/Kobon paradigm** [NEEDS SOURCE for which language(s) exactly]:
- Present
- Today's past (hodiernal)
- Yesterday's past
- Remote past (before yesterday)
- Habitual past
- Future

**Sogeram languages**:
- Present (diachronically stable)
- Most remote past (diachronically stable)
- Middle past(s) (unstable, vary across languages)
- Future (unstable)

**Source**: Daniels, Don. "The history of tense and aspect in the Sogeram family."

**"Double tense" marking** (Duna, Foe):
- Simultaneous specification of perception time and event time
- Allows distinguishing when event occurred vs. when evidence was obtained

**Translation implications**:
- Greek aorist/perfect/imperfect may need multiple past tenses
- Hebrew waw-consecutive requires careful tense sequencing
- Aspectual distinctions in source texts need careful attention

### 6.3 Aspect

- **Perfective** vs. **Imperfective** distinctions common
- Progressive often marked with grammaticalized serial verb ('stay')
- Completive aspects from verbs like 'finish'

### 6.4 Mood

- **Realis** vs. **Irrealis** distinctions widespread
- Imperative, hortative, jussive categories present
- Some languages conflate future and hortative (e.g., Koromu shows future tense/hortative overlap)

**Translation implications**:
- Subjunctive and optative moods map to irrealis
- Dual tense systems useful for reported events with evidential distinctions
