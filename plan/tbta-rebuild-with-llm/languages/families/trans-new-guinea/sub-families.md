### Madang Family

**Location**: Madang Province, north coast

**Size**: ~80+ languages, ~80,000 speakers - **Largest sub-family by language count**

**Features**:
- High linguistic diversity
- **Amele**: Famous for 32 possessive classes
- Typical clause chaining and switch-reference

**Translation relevance**:

**Features**:
- Mountainous region with high elevation differences
- **Yopno**: Famous for uphill/downhill spatial and temporal system

### Ok-Oksapmin Family

**Location**: Highlands border PNG-Indonesia

**Languages in dataset**: Telefol, Oksapmin, Tifal, Faiwol, Bimin, Mian

**Features**:
- **Evidentiality**: Part of Highlands Evidentiality Area
- **Mian** and **Telefol**: Triple-indexing, head-marking, morphologically complex
- Grammaticalization studies (Mountain Ok languages)
- Reciprocal constructions with unique grammaticalization [NEEDS SOURCE]

**Translation relevance**:
- Complex verb morphology requires extensive linguistic training
- Evidential marking critical
- Triple-indexing (subject, object, and additional argument on verb) affects clause structure
- Border location affects language policy and orthography standardization

**Source**: Pawley & Hammarström (2018); San Roque et al. for evidentiality

---

### Duna-Bogaya Family

**Location**: Hela and Southern Highlands provinces

**Languages in dataset**: Duna

**Features**:
- **Evidentiality**: Part of Highlands Evidentiality Area
- **"Double tense" system**: Marks both event time and evidence acquisition time
- Ergative case acquisition studied

**Translation relevance**:
- Double tense allows distinguishing when event occurred vs. when speaker learned about it
- Critical for reported events and historical narrative
- Evidential + tense interaction creates nuanced information source marking

**Source**: Pawley & Hammarström (2018); San Roque et al. for evidentiality; Rumsey for Duna ergative

### Kutubuan Languages

**Classification**: East and West Kutubu (subgroup 22)

**Location**: Southern Highlands Province

**Languages in dataset**: Fasu, Foe

**Features**:
- **Evidentiality**: Part of Highlands Evidentiality Area
- **Fasu**: Visual evidential marked by circumfix [NEEDS SOURCE]
- **Foe**: Double tense system [NEEDS SOURCE]

**Translation relevance**:
- Circumfix evidential (prefix + suffix) creates complex morphology
- Double tense in Foe similar to Duna (see above)

**Source**: Pawley & Hammarström (2018); San Roque et al. for evidentiality

### Binandere Family (Greater Binanderean)

**Location**: Oro Province, PNG

**Features**:
- Coastal and lowland languages (unlike many TNG groups)
- Disputed membership in some classifications

**Translation relevance**:
- Lowland location may mean less elevation-based spatial marking
- May lack evidentiality (not in Highlands Evidentiality Area)
- Disputed membership suggests possible divergent features from core TNG

**Source**: Pawley & Hammarström (2018)

### Goilalan Family

**Location**: Central Province, PNG

**Languages in dataset**: Fuyug, Kunimaipa

**Features**:
- **Fuyug**: Morphologically much simpler than typical TNG
- Less elaborate verb morphology than highland languages

**Translation relevance**:
- Simpler morphology may be easier for translators to learn
- May lack some typical TNG features (switch-reference complexity, etc.)
- Requires careful documentation to identify actual system

**Source**: Pawley & Hammarström (2018); Foley for morphological simplicity

**Features**:
- **Kimaghama**: Isolating morphology (minimal inflection) [NEEDS SOURCE]
- Contrasts sharply with polysynthetic TNG languages

**Translation relevance**:
- Isolating morphology means minimal verb morphology
- May lack medial/final verb distinction
- Simpler for translators to learn but may lack grammatical marking resources
- Requires different translation strategies from polysynthetic TNG languages

**Source**: Pawley & Hammarström (2018); Foley for morphological type

## Notable Cross-Cutting Features

### The Highlands Evidentiality Area

A geographically concentrated feature affecting multiple sub-families:

**Families with evidentiality**:
- Ok-Oksapmin
- Duna-Bogaya
- Engan (Enga-Kewa-Huli)
- Kutubuan (East/West)
- Bosavi

**Translation impact**: Evidential marking becomes the most critical grammatical feature for these languages, requiring systematic strategies for marking information source in every statement.

---

### Highly Polysynthetic Languages

Languages with extensive verbal morphology:

**Examples**:
- Mian (Ok)
- Telefol (Ok)
- Many Madang languages

**Translation impact**: Complex verb paradigms require extensive linguistic training and careful documentation of morphological patterns.

---

### Morphologically Simpler Languages

Languages with reduced morphological complexity:

**Examples**:
- Fuyug (Goilalan)
- Kimaghama (Kolopom) [NEEDS SOURCE]

**Translation impact**: Simpler systems easier to learn but may lack grammatical resources for explicit participant tracking, requiring different discourse strategies.

---

### Geographic Concentrations

**Highlands groups** (Enga, Chimbu, Eastern Highlands, Ok, Duna):
- Evidentiality common
- Multiple past tense distinctions
- Elevation-based spatial deixis
- High morphological complexity

**Coastal/Lowland groups** (Binandere, some Madang):
- Less evidentiality
- Still have clause chaining
- May have reduced elevation marking [NEEDS SOURCE]

**Border region** (Ok, Mek, Dani in Indonesia):
- International distribution affects language policy
- Orthography standardization across borders
- Translation coordination between PNG and Indonesia

## Research Gaps

Several sub-families in our dataset require additional research:

1. **Koiarian**: Limited information in sources consulted
2. **Kolopom**: Verify which languages in dataset belong to this family
3. **Angan**: Disputed membership affects feature predictions
4. **Binandere**: Coastal features may differ from highlands; needs documentation
5. **Individual language mapping**: Several languages in dataset not clearly mapped to sub-families

For translation projects in these languages, extensive fieldwork and linguistic documentation will be necessary before beginning translation work.
