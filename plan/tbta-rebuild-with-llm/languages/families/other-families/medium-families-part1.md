# Medium Language Families - Part 1 (10-24 Languages)

This document covers the first set of medium-sized language families (Arawakan through Tupian).

**Total in this file**: 4 families with 66 languages

---

## 6. Maipurean / Arawakan (20 languages)

**Languages in dataset**: Ajyíninka Apurucayali, Apurinã, Asháninka, Ashéninka (Pajonal, Pichis, South Ucayali, Ucayali-Yurúa), Caquinte, Garifuna, Ignaciano, Matsigenka, Nomatsigenga, Palikúr, Parecís, Piapoco, Terêna, Wapishana, Yanesha', Yine, Yucuna

**Geographic distribution**: South America (Amazon basin, Orinoco, Caribbean)

### Unique Grammatical Features

#### 1. Morphological Structure (Source: ResearchGate)
- Synthetic, predominantly head-marking, suffixing
- Closed and historically stable set of prefixes:
  - Bound pronouns on verbs
  - Relativizing prefix ka-
  - Negative counterpart ma-

#### 2. Person Marking (Source: ScienceDirect)
- Prefixes mark:
  - Subject of transitive verb
  - Subject of intransitive active verb
  - Possessor on nouns
- Suffixes/enclitics express (in 2/3 of languages):
  - Object of transitive verb (O)
  - Subject of stative verbs (So)
  - Subject of non-verbal predicates

#### 3. Agreement Prefixes (Source: ScienceDirect)
- Proto-forms reconstructed:
  - *nu- = 1SG
  - *pi- = 2SG
  - *ri- = 3SG MASC
  - *tu- = 3SG FEM
  - *wa- = 1PL
  - *xi- = 2PL
  - *na- = 3PL

#### 4. Noun Classification (Source: Oxford Research Encyclopedia)
- More than half the languages have complex classifier systems
- Classifiers on:
  - Number words
  - Verbs
  - Possessive constructions
  - Nouns themselves
- Categorize nouns by: shape, consistency, animacy

#### 5. Gender Distinction (Source: Oxford Research Encyclopedia)
- Most languages distinguish masculine/feminine in:
  - 3rd person singular pronouns
  - Demonstratives
  - Nominalizations
  - Adjective agreement markers

#### 6. Possession (Source: SIL.org)
- If possessor not specified, nouns take unpossessed form (marked with suffix)
- Same suffix used as nominalizer on verbs
- Alienably possessed nouns: possessive prefix + additional suffix (based on noun meaning)

### Translation-Relevant Distinctions

- **Head-marking**: Grammatical relations marked on head (verb), not dependents
- **Masculine/feminine distinction**: Gender must be tracked for proper agreement
- **Classifier systems**: Correct classifier selection requires semantic knowledge of noun properties
- **Possession alienability**: Different constructions for alienable vs. inalienable possession

## 7. Sino-Tibetan (18 languages)

**Languages in dataset**: Burmese, Chin (Eastern Khumi, Matu, Siyin, Thado, Thaiphum, Zyphe), Chinese (Mandarin), Limbu, Sunwar, Tamang (Eastern), Zaiwa

**Geographic distribution**: East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia (China, Myanmar, India, Nepal, Bhutan)

### Unique Grammatical Features

#### 1. Tonal Systems (Source: Britannica)
- Most languages possess phonemic tones
- Tone distribution varies considerably:
  - Tibetan: 2 tones
  - Burmese: 3 tones
  - Mandarin Chinese: 4 tones
  - Cantonese: up to 9 tones
- Classical Tibetan was NOT tonal
- Modern varieties (Central, Khams Tibetan) developed tone registers
- Proto-Sino-Tibetan: can reconstruct conditioning factors for tones, NOT tones themselves

#### 2. Classifier Systems (Source: Britannica)
- Noun is typically collective term (all members of class)
- Counted/modified by demonstrative only indirectly through classifiers
- Classifiers = smaller number of non-collective nouns
- Phenomenon ABSENT in Tibetan
- Appears late in Burmese and Chinese
- NOT exclusively Sino-Tibetan: also in Hmong-Mien, Tai, Austric, Japanese

#### 3. Structural Characteristics (Source: Britannica)
- Vast majority of words monosyllabic at proto-language stage
- Word order: subject-object-verb in Tibeto-Burman (except Chinese, Karenic which are SVO)
- Analytic grammar: relies heavily on word order rather than inflection

#### 4. Morphological Diversity (Source: Wikipedia)
- Structurally one of world's most diverse families
- Gradation from isolating to polysynthetic:
  - Isolating: Lolo-Burmese, Tujia
  - Polysynthetic: Gyalrongic, Kiranti

### Translation-Relevant Distinctions

- **Tone critical for meaning**: Tonal errors change word meanings entirely
- **Classifier selection**: Requires semantic knowledge of noun categories
- **Analytic structure**: Grammatical relations conveyed by word order, not morphology
- **Monosyllabic tendency**: Complex ideas expressed through multi-word compounds
- **Word order variation**: Some branches verb-final, others verb-medial

## 8. Quechuan (18 languages)

**Languages in dataset**: Inga, Quechua (Cajamarca, Eastern Apurímac, Huallaga, Huamalíes-Dos de Mayo Huánuco, Huaylas Ancash, Huaylla Wanca, Lambayeque, Margos-Yarowilca-Lauricocha, North Bolivian, North Junín, Northern Conchucos Ancash, Panao, San Martín, South Bolivian, Southern Conchucos), Quichua (Northern Pastaza, Southern Pastaza)

**Geographic distribution**: South America (Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Argentina, Chile)

### Unique Grammatical Features

#### 1. Agglutination (Source: Wikipedia)
- Very highly agglutinating
- Words built from basic roots + multiple suffixes
- Each suffix carries one meaning
- Very regular (not isolating or fusional)
- Single words can express complex ideas (sometimes lengthy)

#### 2. Evidentiality (Source: Wikipedia - most distinctive feature)
- THREE-TERM EVIDENTIAL SYSTEM
- Three morphemes mark varying levels of source information
- Speakers must indicate source of information:
  - Direct evidence (saw it)
  - Reported evidence (heard it)
  - Inferred evidence (inferred it)
- NOT grammatical requirement in most European languages
- Evidentials are "second position enclitics"
- Usually attach to first constituent in sentence

#### 3. Bipersonal Conjugation (Source: Wikipedia)
- Verbs agree with BOTH subject and object

#### 4. Additional Grammatical Features (Source: Wikipedia)
- Topic particles
- Benefactive suffixes (who benefits from action)
- Attitudinal suffixes (speaker's attitude toward action)

### Translation-Relevant Distinctions

- **Evidentiality obligatory**: Translators must interpret/add evidential information absent in source languages without evidentiality
- **Agglutinative structure**: Long words with multiple suffixes require careful morpheme-by-morpheme analysis
- **Bipersonal agreement**: Both subject and object marked on verb
- **Topic marking**: Information structure differs from subject-prominent languages
- **Attitude marking**: Speaker perspective grammatically encoded

## 9. Tupian (12 languages)

**Languages in dataset**: Guajajára, Guaraní (Eastern Bolivian, Mbyá, Western Bolivian), Guarayu, Kaapor, Kaiwá, Kayabí, Mundurukú, Sateré-Mawé, Sirionó, Tenharim

**Geographic distribution**: South America (Amazon basin - original homeland between Mamoré and Aripuanã rivers in Madeira River Basin)

### Unique Grammatical Features

#### 1. Rich Morphology (Source: Oxford Research Encyclopedia)
- Expressed mainly by suffixes and prefixes
- Particles also important for grammatical categories
- Verbal morphology characterized by rich valence-changing formations

#### 2. Word Order (Source: Wikipedia)
- Basic word order in most families: SOV
- Shift toward SVO in some languages (e.g., Tupi) due to Portuguese contact influence

#### 3. Noun Incorporation (Source: Wikipedia - Old Tupi)
- Objects of transitive verbs may come before, after, or incorporated into verb
- When incorporated:
  - 1st class verbs: after person markers
  - Otherwise: before root

#### 4. Word Formation Processes (Source: ACL Anthology)
- Diminutive/augmentative
- Compounding
- Reduplication
- Noun incorporation

#### 5. Proto-Tupí Diversification (Source: Oxford Research Encyclopedia)
- Started diversifying around 5,000 years ago
- Homeland: Mamoré-Aripuanã confluence area

### Translation-Relevant Distinctions

- **SOV word order**: Different from Portuguese/Spanish contact languages
- **Incorporation**: Single verb word can include noun argument
- **Valence operations**: Rich system of causatives, applicatives affecting argument structure
- **Low-resource context**: TuLaR project works on computational/pedagogical materials for Brazilian indigenous languages
