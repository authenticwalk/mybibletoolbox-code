## 1. Otomanguean (69 languages)

**Languages in dataset**: Amuzgo (Guerrero, San Pedro Amuzgos), Chatino (Nopala, Tataltepec, Western Highland), Chinantec (Comaltepec, Lalana, Lealao, Ozumacín, Palantla, Quiotepec, Sochiapam, Tepetotutla, Usila), Cuicatec (Tepeuxila, Teutila), Mazahua (Central), Mazatec (Ayautla, Chiquihuitlán, Huautla, Jalapa de Díaz, San Jerónimo Tecóatl), Mixtec (Atatlahuca, Chayuco, Coatzospan, Diuxi-Tilantongo, Jamiltepec, Magdalena Peñasco, Ocotepec, Peñoles, Pinotepa Nacional, San Juan Colorado, San Miguel el Grande, Silacayoapan, Southern Puebla, Tezoatlán, Yosondúa), Otomi (Eastern Highland, Mezquital, Querétaro, Tenango, Estado de México), Popoloca (San Juan Atzingo, San Marcos Tlacoyalco), Triqui (Copala), Zapotec (Amatlán, Cajonos, Chichicapan, Choapan, Coatecas Altas, Isthmus, Lachixío, Miahuatlán, Mitla, Mixtepec, Ocotlán, Ozolotepec, Quioquitani-Quierí, Rincón, Santo Domingo Albarradas, Sierra de Juárez, Southern Rincon, Tabaa, Texmelucan, Western Tlacolula Valley, Yalálag, Yatee, Yatzachi, Zoogocho)

**Geographic distribution**: Mesoamerica, primarily Mexico (Oaxaca, Puebla, Guerrero, Veracruz states)

### Unique Grammatical Features

#### 1. Tone Systems (Source: Wikipedia - Oto-Manguean languages)
- ALL Oto-Manguean languages are tonal - oldest language family with evidence of tonal contrast in proto-language
- Three-tone systems most common (Popolocan, Tlapanec, Amuzgo, Mixtecan, Zapotecan, Chinantecan)
- Two-tone systems in Oto-Pamean
- Complex systems: Usila Chinantec has FIVE level tones
- Tone distinguishes both root meanings AND grammatical categories
- Tone used extensively for inflection

#### 2. Aspect-Oriented Verbal System (Source: Wikipedia)
- Aspect more relevant than tense
- Valency and aspect (transitive, intransitive, causative, inchoative, iterative, imperfective, perfective) marked by prefixes/proclitics
- Person and number of subject/object expressed by suffixes/clitics

#### 3. Word Order (Source: Wikipedia)
- Head-initial structure
- Predominant word order: Verb-Subject-Object (VSO)

#### 4. Noun Classifiers (Source: Wikipedia)
- Some languages have classifiers marking: human, familiar person, animate, house, fruit

#### 5. Inflectional Complexity (Source: Compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com)
- Due to large tone inventory used for inflection, these languages have some of the most complex inflection systems in the world

### Translation-Relevant Distinctions

- **Low-resource technology challenge**: Models drastically underperform for Oto-Manguean languages due to complex inflection in stems, affixes, AND tonal changes all present in one word (Source: Multilingual-technologies.netlify.app)
- **Tonal accuracy critical**: Tone changes affect both lexical meaning and grammatical function
- **Aspect vs. tense**: Translators must recognize aspect-based rather than tense-based temporal systems
- **Complex morphology**: Single words may encode multiple grammatical categories through tone, affixes, and stem changes

## 2. Mayan (41 languages)

**Languages in dataset**: Achi, Akateko, Awakateko, Chol, Chontal (Tabasco), Chuj, Ch'orti', Huastec, Ixil, Jakalteko, Kaqchikel, K'iche', Lacandon, Mam, Maya (Mopán), Poqomchi', Q'eqchi', Tektiteko, Tojolabal, Tzotzil, Tz'utujil, Uspanteko

**Geographic distribution**: Mesoamerica (Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras)

### Unique Grammatical Features

#### 1. Ergativity (Source: Wikipedia - Mayan languages)
- Morphologically ergative alignment
- Subject of intransitive verb treated similarly to object of transitive verb
- Two sets of affixes:
  - Set B: subjects of intransitive verbs + objects of transitive verbs
  - Set A: subjects of transitive verbs
- Syntactic ergativity: constraints on extraction of transitive subjects for focus/interrogation/negation/relativization

#### 2. Polysynthetic Verb Complex (Source: MustGo.com)
- Uses both prefixes and suffixes for grammatical function
- Affixes signal aspect, tense, mood
- Directional clitics placed after aspect/absolutive markers
- Position varies: before verb (intransitive) or before ergative marker (transitive)

#### 3. Rich Voice System (Source: Wikipedia)
- Proto-Mayan had at least one passive construction
- Antipassive rule for downplaying agent relative to patient
- Multiple voice-changing operations available

#### 4. Word Order (Source: Bilinguistics.com)
- Verb-initial: VOS or VSO
- Contrasts sharply with English SVO

### Translation-Relevant Distinctions

- **Ergative alignment**: Requires different conceptualization of subject/object relationships than accusative languages
- **Polysynthesis**: Single verb can express what requires multiple words in English
- **Extraction constraints**: Syntactic ergativity affects question formation, focus constructions, relative clauses
- **Directional system**: Grammaticalized directional meanings require careful interpretation

## 3. Australian (36 languages)

**Languages in dataset**: Alyawarr, Anindilyakwa, Anmatyerre, Arrarnta (Western), Arrernte (Eastern), Awabakal, Burarra, Dhangu-Djangu, Dhuwaya, Diyari, Djambarrpuyngu, Djinang, Garrwa, Gumatj, Gunwinggu, Kala Lagaw Ya, Kuku-Yalanji, Kunjen, Kuuk Thayorre, Martu Wangka, Maung, Murrinh-Patha, Ngaanyatjarra, Ngarrindjeri, Nunggubuyu, Nyangumarta, Nyungar, Pintupi-Luritja, Pitjantjatjara, Tiwi, Walmajarri, Warlpiri, Wik-Mungkan, Worrorra, Yanyuwa

**Geographic distribution**: Australia

### Unique Grammatical Features

#### 1. Case Systems (Source: Wikipedia - Australian Aboriginal languages)
- Many languages have ergative-absolutive case systems
- Split ergativity patterns common:
  - Pronouns (1st/2nd person) use nominative-accusative
  - 3rd person uses ergative-absolutive
  - Alternative split: animate vs. inanimate

#### 2. Free Word Order (Source: Britannica)
- Many languages feature free word order
- Contrasts dramatically with English syntactic ordering
- Syntactic coherence created by:
  - Verb inflection
  - Noun case marking
- NOT by word order

#### 3. Kinship-Influenced Grammar (Source: Wikipedia)
- Kinship relations shape grammar in ways seen nowhere else
- Dual pronouns (referring to two persons) have distinct forms based on relationship between referents
- Example from Warlpiri: triangular terms indicate relation of both speaker and listener to referent
  - "my mother who is also your father's sister"

#### 4. Avoidance Speech Registers (Source: Wikipedia)
- Special speech registers used only in presence of certain close relatives
- Share phonology and grammar with standard language
- Different and restricted lexicon

### Translation-Relevant Distinctions

- **Kinship untranslatability**: English "uncle" has no exact equivalent; Western Desert uses different words for mother's brother vs. father's brother
- **Free word order**: Cannot rely on position to determine grammatical relations
- **Case marking critical**: Must attend to case suffixes, not word order
- **Split ergativity**: Treatment of arguments varies by person/animacy hierarchy
- **Avoidance registers**: Some texts may use specialized vocabulary requiring cultural knowledge

## 4. Afro-Asiatic (25 languages)

**Languages in dataset**: Arabic (Standard), Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, Coptic, Dangaléat, Dawro, Gamo, Gofa, Hamer-Banna, Hausa, Hdi, Hebrew, Hebrew (Ancient), Male, Mbuko, Merey, Muyang, Somali, Wolaytta

**Geographic distribution**: North Africa, Horn of Africa, Middle East (primarily Semitic, Chadic, Cushitic branches represented)

### Unique Grammatical Features

#### 1. Root-and-Pattern Morphology (Source: Britannica)
- Basic word meaning manifested in consonants alone
- Vowel sequence (pattern) adds grammatical information
- May combine with prefixes/suffixes
- Classic Arabic example: K-T-B root (writing)
  - KiTaB = book
  - KaTaBa = to write
  - KaTtaBa = to make write (teach)
  - maKTaB = office
  - KaaTiB = writer
  - maKTaBa = library
  - miKTaB = typewriter
  - KuTuBii = bookseller
  - maKTuuB = fate ("that which is written")

#### 2. Consonant and Vowel Lengthening (Source: Wikipedia)
- Gemination (consonant lengthening) common throughout family
- Vowel lengthening (double vowels) also common

#### 3. Grammatical Gender (Source: Wikipedia)
- Most languages use masculine/feminine gender
- Exceptions exist (some Central Chadic languages)

#### 4. Tonal Distribution (Source: Wikipedia)
- Majority of languages are tonal: Omotic, Chadic, Cushitic
- Tone ABSENT in Berber and Semitic branches

#### 5. Universal Categories (Source: MustGo.com)
- All have: verb, noun, adposition (prepositions/postpositions)

### Translation-Relevant Distinctions

- **Consonantal roots**: Root meaning preserved across derivations; vowel patterns modify meaning
- **Non-linear morphology**: Cannot simply segment words linearly; must recognize root-pattern interdigitation
- **Tonal variation**: Some branches tonal, others not - affects transliteration and phonological analysis
- **Gender agreement**: Extensive gender concord throughout noun phrases and verb agreement

## 5. Uto-Aztecan (21 languages)

**Languages in dataset**: Cora (El Nayar), Hopi, Huichol, Nahuatl (Central Huasteca, Eastern Huasteca, Guerrero, Highland Puebla, Michoacán, Northern Oaxaca, Northern Puebla, Southeastern Puebla, Tetelcingo, Western Huasteca, Zacatlán-Ahuacatlán-Tepetzintla), Paiute (Northern), Tarahumara (Western), Tepehuan (Northern, Southeastern), Tohono O'odham, Yaqui

**Geographic distribution**: Southwestern United States and Mexico (from Oregon to Panama historically, concentrated in Mexico)

### Unique Grammatical Features

#### 1. Polysynthetic Structure (Source: EBSCO Research Starters)
- Verbs carry multiple grammatical functions within single word
- Complex verb constructions can form complete sentences independently
- Functions blended into verb via suffixes, prefixes, infixes, vowel variation:
  - Subjective pronouns
  - Objective pronouns
  - Reflexive pronouns
  - Tense markers
  - Voice markers
  - Mode markers
  - Direction markers

#### 2. Incorporation (Source: Wikipedia)
- Highly incorporative languages
- Multiple affixes added to roots form very long words

#### 3. Word Order (Source: Wikipedia)
- Verbs placed after subjects and objects in clauses (SOV tendency)

#### 4. Classical Nahuatl Example (Source: EBSCO)
- "onikpix" = complete sentence "I held it"
  - o- = past tense marker
  - ni- = "I"
  - k- = "it"
  - pix = "to have/hold"

#### 5. Development of Polysynthesis (Source: Academia.edu)
- Multiple non-polysynthetic Uto-Aztecan languages display properties attributed to polysynthesis
- Nahuatl polysynthesis developed in discrete series of stages
- Each stage has attestation elsewhere in family

### Translation-Relevant Distinctions

- **Verb-centered syntax**: Single verb word can express entire proposition
- **Multiple arguments**: Verbs can incorporate subject, object, direction, tense, aspect, mode
- **Pronoun incorporation**: Separate pronoun words not always required
- **Complex morpheme ordering**: Strict ordering of affixes within verb complex
