# Indo-European Branch Profiles: Part 2

This document covers the remaining Indo-European branches in our dataset: Indo-Iranian, Celtic, Greek (Hellenic), Albanian, Armenian, Baltic, and Romani.

---

## 1. Indo-Iranian Branch

**Modern languages in dataset:**
- **Indo-Aryan:** Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, Punjabi, Assamese, Odia, Nepali, Sanskrit
- **Iranian:** Persian, Kurdish, Tajik, Gilaki

The Indo-Iranian branch is the largest in our dataset with 20 languages.

### 1.1 Key Features

#### Ergativity (Indo-Aryan)

**Unique in Indo-European:** Split ergativity based on aspect/tense

**Split ergative system:**
- **Nominative-accusative** alignment in non-perfective aspects
- **Ergative-absolutive** alignment in perfective aspects ONLY

**How it works:**

**Non-perfective (nominative-accusative):**
- Subject marked identically for transitive and intransitive verbs (nominative)
- Object marked with accusative

**Perfective (ergative-absolutive):**
- Subject of transitive verb takes ergative case (*-ne* in Hindi/Urdu)
- Subject of intransitive verb takes absolutive (no special marking)
- Object takes absolutive (no special marking)
- **Verb agrees with object** (if present) instead of subject

**Example (Hindi):**

Non-perfective (present tense):
- *Laṛkā kitāb paṛhtā hai* (Boy book reads)
- Subject: *laṛkā* (nominative)
- Verb agrees with subject

Perfective (past tense):
- *Laṛke-ne kitāb paṛhī* (Boy-ERG book.FEM read.FEM)
- Subject: *laṛke-ne* (ergative case with *-ne*)
- Verb agrees with **object** (*kitāb*, feminine) → *paṛhī* (feminine form)

**Geographic distribution:**

**Western Indo-Aryan (retain ergativity):**
- Hindi
- Urdu
- Marathi
- Gujarati
- Punjabi
- Nepali (partially)

**Eastern Indo-Aryan (lost ergative features):**
- Bengali
- Odia
- Assamese
- Eastern Hindi dialects

**Diachronic development:**
- Not inherited from PIE or Sanskrit (which were nominative-accusative)
- Developed in Middle Indo-Aryan period from passive construction reanalysis
- Currently being lost in Eastern IA; spreading/strengthening in Western IA

---

#### Case System Evolution

**Sanskrit (Old Indo-Aryan): 8 cases**
- Full PIE case system preserved:
  1. Nominative
  2. Accusative
  3. Genitive
  4. Dative
  5. Ablative
  6. Locative
  7. Instrumental
  8. Vocative

**Middle Indo-Aryan: Case system collapsed**
- Phonological erosion of case endings
- Postpositions developed to replace case functions
- Lost distinctions merged

**New Indo-Aryan: Case system reinvented**
- New case markers developed from:
  - Postpositions
  - Clitic particles
  - Grammaticalized nouns
- Different structure from Sanskrit cases

**Modern case inventories (varies by language):**
- **Hindi/Urdu:** 2-3 direct cases + postpositions
  - Direct (nominative/absolutive)
  - Oblique (used with postpositions)
  - Vocative
  - Ergative *-ne* (in perfective only)
- **Bengali:** 2 cases
  - Nominative
  - Objective/Genitive
- **Marathi:** 8 cases (full system reinvented)

**Key insight:** Modern Indo-Aryan case systems are NOT continuations of Sanskrit, but new innovations

---

#### Iranian Language Features

**Major differences from Indo-Aryan:**

**1. Lack of grammatical gender** (in most Iranian languages)
- **Persian:** No grammatical gender
- **Kurdish:** No grammatical gender
- **Tajik:** No grammatical gender (Persian dialect)
- **Pashto:** 2 genders (masculine/feminine) - exception

**Contrast with Indo-Aryan:**
- Hindi/Urdu: 2 genders (masculine/feminine)
- Sanskrit: 3 genders (masculine/feminine/neuter)

**2. Ergativity in past tense** (some Iranian languages)
- Kurdish (Kurmanji, Sorani): Ergative in past tenses
- Pashto: Ergative system
- Persian: No ergativity (lost)

**3. Present/past stem dichotomy**
- Most Iranian verbs have two stems:
  - **Present stem:** Used for present, imperfect, subjunctive
  - **Past stem:** Used for all past tenses
- Often unpredictable relationship between stems
- Example (Persian):
  - *raft-an* (infinitive, "to go")
  - Present stem: *rav-* → *mi-rav-am* "I go"
  - Past stem: *raft-* → *raft-am* "I went"

**4. VSO word order tendency** (some Iranian)
- Kurdish tends toward VSO
- Persian is SOV

**Sources:**
- Encyclopedia.com. "Indo-Iranian languages"
- Various grammatical descriptions of individual languages

---

#### Sanskrit Preservation

**Most conservative Indo-European language**

**Features preserved from PIE:**
- **Full 8-case system**
- **3 genders** (masculine, feminine, neuter)
- **3 numbers** (singular, dual, plural) - fully productive
- **Rich verbal system:**
  - Active, middle, passive voices
  - Multiple tenses and aspects
  - Subjunctive, optative, imperative moods
- **Ablaut (vowel gradation)** system
- **Sandhi rules** (complex phonological interactions)

**Relationship to PIE:**
- Very close to PIE in structure
- Often used as proxy for PIE in comparative linguistics
- Vedic Sanskrit (oldest form) even more conservative

**Multiple Bible translations:**
- Dataset includes multiple Sanskrit translations
- Historically important for comparative biblical studies
- Shows how PIE-type grammar handles Biblical text

**Modern status:**
- Classical/liturgical language (not native spoken language)
- Highly regular and analyzed grammatical system
- Extensive traditional grammatical literature (Pāṇini's grammar, 5th-4th century BCE)

---

### 1.2 Translation Implications

**Ergativity creates unique challenges:**
- Transitive subjects in perfective contexts require different marking
- Verb agreement switches from subject to object
- Greek and Hebrew are nominative-accusative throughout
- Example: "He read the book" (aorist/perfective)
  - Greek: Subject nominative, verb agrees with subject
  - Hindi: Subject ergative (*-ne*), verb agrees with object

**Aspect-based splits:**
- Hindi/Urdu aspectual distinctions align with Greek in some ways
- But grammatical marking (ergativity) complicates direct correspondence
- Translator must track both aspect AND alignment

**Sanskrit's conservatism:**
- Excellent for understanding Hebrew/Greek grammar
- Full case system matches Greek complexity
- Can express Greek case nuances precisely
- But Sanskrit is not a living spoken language (affects naturalness)

**No articles in most Indo-Iranian languages:**
- Like Hebrew/Greek, Indo-Iranian typically lacks articles
- Matches Biblical languages in this respect
- Persian has *-e* suffix for indefinite, but no definite article
- Hindi has some article-like markers but not required

**Persian/Kurdish gender loss:**
- Simplifies some translation issues
- No forced gender assignment for neuter Greek terms
- But loses gender agreement information that Greek conveys

**Iranian SOV word order:**
- Different from Greek SVO and Hebrew VSO/VOS
- Creates word order challenges
- Persian relatively rigid SOV (less flexible than Greek)

**Summary:** Indo-Iranian languages present unique challenges (especially ergativity) but also advantages (no articles, aspect distinctions, Sanskrit's conservatism).

## 2. Celtic Branch

**Modern languages in dataset:** Breton

**Note:** Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, Cornish, and Manx not in current dataset (but discussed for completeness)

### 2.1 Key Features

#### VSO Word Order

**Verb-Subject-Object order is rigidly maintained**

**Unique among IE languages:**
- Most IE languages are SVO (English, Romance, Slavic) or SOV (Persian, Sanskrit, ancient Latin tendency)
- Only Celtic consistently maintains VSO
- Some other language families have VSO (Semitic, Austronesian, Mayan)

**Examples:**

Irish: *Bhuail sé mé*
- *Bhuail* (hit, past) + *sé* (he) + *mé* (me)
- Literally: "Hit he me" = "He hit me"

Welsh: *Gwelodd y dyn y ci*
- *Gwelodd* (saw) + *y dyn* (the man) + *y ci* (the dog)
- Literally: "Saw the man the dog" = "The man saw the dog"

**Rigid order:**
- Cannot reorder to SVO or SOV without grammatical error
- Exceptions only in certain subordinate clauses or emphatic constructions

**Sources:**
- Wiley Online Library. "VSO Word Order in the Celtic Languages" (Rouveret)
- Wikipedia. "Verb–subject–object word order"
- Scottish Gaelic Grammar Wiki. "Word Order"

---

#### Initial Consonant Mutations

**Defining feature of Celtic:** Word-initial consonants change based on grammatical context

**Types of mutation (Irish example):**

**1. Lenition (softening):**
- *cat* (cat) → *mo chat* (my cat) - *c* → *ch*
- *bean* (woman) → *a bhean* (his woman) - *b* → *bh*
- *Seán* (John) → *a Sheáin* (O John!) - *S* → *Sh*

**2. Eclipsis (nasalization):**
- *cat* (cat) → *ár gcat* (our cat) - *c* → *gc*
- *bád* (boat) → *ár mbád* (our boat) - *b* → *mb*

**3. H-prothesis:**
- *ól* (drink) → *a hól* (her drinking) - *ól* → *hól*

**Triggering contexts:**
- Preceded by certain particles, prepositions, possessives
- After certain verb forms
- Gender agreement
- Case relationships (historically)

**Original conditioning factors lost:**
- Once indicated phonological environment or case relationships
- Now largely arbitrary (must be memorized)
- Marks grammatical relationships and syntactic functions

**Quote from sources:** "Unknown in any other attested Indo-European language"

**Functions:**
- Marks possession relationships
- Indicates gender of possessor
- Marks case distinctions (historically)
- Signals syntactic relationships

**Sources:**
- Core.ac.uk. "Celtic initial consonant mutations"
- Wikipedia. "Insular Celtic languages"

---

#### Inflected Prepositions

**Prepositions inflect for person and number**

**Example (Irish preposition *ag* "at"):**
- *agam* = "at me" (at-1SG)
- *agat* = "at you" (at-2SG)
- *aige* = "at him" (at-3SG.MASC)
- *aici* = "at her" (at-3SG.FEM)
- *againn* = "at us" (at-1PL)
- *agaibh* = "at you (plural)" (at-2PL)
- *acu* = "at them" (at-3PL)

**Usage:**
- Replaces pronoun + preposition construction
- English: "with me" → Irish: *liom* (single inflected word)
- Highly synthetic

**Multiple prepositions inflect:**
- *le* "with" → *liom, leat, leis, léi,* etc.
- *ar* "on" → *orm, ort, air, uirthi,* etc.
- *ó* "from" → *uaim, uait, uaidh,* etc.

**Unique in IE:** No other modern IE language inflects prepositions this way

---

#### Absolute vs. Conjunct Verb Forms

**Verbs have different conjugations depending on position**

**Absolute forms:**
- Used when verb is in absolute initial position (sentence-initial)
- No element before the verb

**Conjunct forms:**
- Used when verb is preceded by a preverbal particle
- Particles include: negation, interrogatives, relative markers, etc.

**Example (Old Irish):**

Absolute: *berid* "he carries"
Conjunct: *ní·beir* "he does not carry"
- *ní* = negative particle
- *beir* = conjunct form (different from absolute *berid*)

**Modern remnants:**
- Irish still shows absolute/conjunct distinction in irregular verbs
- Regular verbs have largely merged the forms
- Example: *tá* (is, absolute) vs. *níl* (is not, conjunct) - different root

**Quote from sources:** "Unknown in any other attested Indo-European language"

---

#### Case System Loss

**Modern Celtic languages have largely lost case distinctions**

**Old Irish: 5 cases**
- Nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, vocative
- But already simplified from PIE 8 cases

**Modern Celtic: 2-4 cases**
- **Irish:** 3 cases (nominative/accusative, genitive, vocative)
- **Scottish Gaelic:** 4 cases (nominative, genitive, dative, vocative) - but dative mostly merged
- **Welsh:** 2 cases (common case, genitive in pronouns)
- **Breton:** Largely caseless

**Compensation strategies:**
- Mutations mark some relationships
- Word order (rigid VSO) indicates relationships
- Prepositional phrases replace case functions

---

### 2.2 Translation Implications

**VSO order:**
- Dramatically different from Greek (SVO/flexible) and Hebrew (VSO/VOS)
- Celtic VSO matches Hebrew VSO in some respects
- But Greek is more flexible; Celtic is rigidly VSO

**Mutations add complexity:**
- No direct correspondence in Greek or Hebrew
- Mutation rules can mark grammatical relationships Celtic lost via case
- Example: Possessive constructions marked by mutation, not case

**No case system:**
- Similar to Modern Romance; must use prepositions and word order
- Cannot express Greek case nuances directly
- Like English and Romance, requires interpretive decisions

**Inflected prepositions:**
- Can elegantly express some Greek prepositional phrases
- Example: Greek *σὺν ἐμοί* (with me) → Irish *liom* (single word)
- More synthetic than English/Romance analytic constructions

**Small translation base:**
- Only Breton in current dataset
- Limited research on Celtic Bible translation patterns
- Irish and Welsh have long Bible translation traditions (not in dataset)

**Historical note:**
- Celtic languages have important early Bible translation history
- Gothic Bible (Germanic) and Old Irish glosses are early IE witnesses
- But Celtic translations less studied than Germanic or Slavic

---

## 3. Greek (Hellenic) Branch

**Modern languages in dataset:** Ancient Greek (Koine)

### 3.1 Key Features

#### Conservative Case System

**5 cases:**
1. **Nominative** - subject, predicate nominative
2. **Genitive** - possession, source, partitive, description, many other functions
3. **Dative** - indirect object, location, means, interest
4. **Accusative** - direct object, extent, some prepositional objects
5. **Vocative** - direct address

**Lost from PIE:**
- Ablative (merged into genitive)
- Locative (merged into dative)
- Instrumental (merged into dative)

**Retained in Modern Greek:**
- Modern Greek maintains 4 cases (nominative, genitive, accusative, vocative)
- Dative merged with genitive in Modern Greek

**Case usage complexity:**
- Greek cases, especially genitive and dative, have many functions
- Genitive can express: possession, source, partitive, description, subjective/objective relationships, material, etc.
- Dative can express: indirect object, location, time, means, manner, reference, etc.
- Context determines specific function

---

#### Complex Verbal System

**Aspect-based tenses:**

**Primary aspectual distinction:**
1. **Aorist** (perfective) - action viewed as complete whole
2. **Present/Imperfect** (imperfective) - action viewed as ongoing or incomplete
3. **Perfect** (stative) - state resulting from action

**Tense forms:**
- Present (imperfective aspect, present time)
- Imperfect (imperfective aspect, past time)
- Future (various aspects)
- Aorist (perfective aspect, usually past time)
- Perfect (stative aspect, present time)
- Pluperfect (stative aspect, past time)

**Key insight:** Aspect is primary, time reference is secondary
- Aorist is NOT "simple past" - it's perfective aspect (happens to usually be past)
- Present is NOT just "current time" - it's imperfective aspect (happens to usually be present)
- Perfect is stative aspect, not "past with present relevance" (though that's often the effect)

**Voice:**
- **Active:** Subject performs action
- **Middle:** Subject acts on/for itself, or is affected by action
- **Passive:** Subject receives action (distinct from middle in aorist/future)

**Mood:**
- **Indicative:** Statement of fact (all tenses available)
- **Subjunctive:** Possibility, purpose, exhortation (present/aorist only)
- **Optative:** Wish, potential, polite request (present/aorist only)
- **Imperative:** Command (present/aorist only)

**Infinitives and Participles:**
- Inflect for tense/aspect and voice
- Participles additionally inflect for case, gender, number
- Example: *λυόμενος* (being loosed, present middle/passive participle, nom.masc.sg)

---

#### Definite Article

**Greek developed definite article** (Latin and Sanskrit lack this)

**Forms:** Article inflects for gender, number, case
- 3 genders × 5 cases × 2 numbers = 30 potential forms
- Actual forms: 17 distinct forms due to syncretism ({hellenistic-greek}: genitive plural is identical across genders, neuter nominative and accusative are identical in each number, and neuter genitive/dative are identical to masculine)

**Functions:**
- Mark definiteness: *ὁ ἄνθρωπος* "the man" vs. *ἄνθρωπος* "a man"
- Substantivize adjectives/phrases: *οἱ ἀγαθοί* "the good (people)"
- Mark known vs. new information
- Anaphoric reference (refer back to previously mentioned)

**No indefinite article:**
- Greek has only definite article
- Indefiniteness expressed by absence of article
- But article absence can also mean: qualitative, generic, indefinite, etc.
- Context determines which reading

**Translation significance:**
- Greek article usage doesn't always match English article usage
- Presence of Greek article doesn't always require English "the"
- Absence of Greek article doesn't always require English "a"

---

#### Phonological Innovation

**Converted PIE voiced aspirates:**
- PIE *bh, dh, gh* → Greek *ph, th, kh* (voiceless aspirates)
- Later these became fricatives in post-Classical Greek: *f, th, x*

**Examples:**
- PIE *\*bʰer-* → Greek *φέρω* (pherō) "I carry"
- PIE *\*dʰeh₁-* → Greek *τίθημι* (tithēmi) "I place"
- PIE *\*gʰosti-* → Greek *ξένος* (xenos) "guest, stranger"

**Other innovations:**
- Lost PIE laryngeals (reconstructed *h₁, h₂, h₃*)
- Developed vowel contractions
- Complex accentuation system

**Source:**
- Cambridge University Press. "Greek (Chapter 11) - The Indo-European Language Family"

---

### 3.2 Translation Implications

**New Testament Greek is the SOURCE language:**
- No "translation implications" for NT
- NT Greek IS the text being translated FROM
- Understanding Greek grammar is essential for translation into all other languages

**Septuagint (OT Greek):**
- Greek translation of Hebrew OT
- Must handle:
  - Hebrew's lack of articles (Greek requires article decisions)
  - Hebrew verbal system (different from Greek aspect system)
  - Hebrew word order (VSO/VOS vs. Greek SVO)
  - Semitic constructs in Greek (Hebraisms)

**Greek aspect system critical for understanding NT:**
- Many translations conflate aspect with tense
- Example: Aorist often translated as simple past, losing perfectivity
- Imperfect often translated same as aorist, losing imperfectivity
- Understanding aspect changes interpretation of many passages

**Example: John 20:31**
- *ἵνα πιστεύσητε* (hina pisteusēte) - aorist subjunctive
- Perfective aspect: "that you may believe" (come to faith)
- Some translations use present: "that you may continue believing"
- Aspect determines whether addressed to non-believers or believers

**Case system requires interpretation:**
- Genitive has many functions - translators must determine which
- Dative has many functions - choice affects meaning
- Example: Genitive in "faith of Christ" vs. "faith in Christ"
  - Greek: *πίστις Χριστοῦ* (pistis Christou)
  - Subjective genitive: "Christ's faith/faithfulness"
  - Objective genitive: "faith in Christ"
  - Context and theology determine interpretation

---

## 4. Albanian Branch

**Modern languages in dataset:** Albanian (Tosk)

### 4.1 Key Features

#### Isolate Branch
- Only surviving member of its branch
- No closely related languages within IE family
- Unclear relationship to other branches (not part of larger subgroup)

#### Helleno-Albanian Connection

**Shared innovations with Greek:**
- Quote from sources: **"Overwhelming" shared innovations** with Greek
- Shared locative plural ending *-si
- Similar treatment of PIE initial *\*i̯-* → obstruent
  - Albanian: *gj-*
  - Greek: *ζ-* (z)

**Debate:**
- Are these shared innovations due to common ancestry (Helleno-Albanian subgroup)?
- Or due to later areal contact (Balkan Sprachbund)?
- Most scholars favor contact over genetic subgroup

**Sources:**
- Cambridge University Press. "Albanian (Chapter 13) - The Indo-European Language Family"
- ResearchGate. "Intriguing linguistic similarities: Albanian-Armenian"

---

#### Balkan Sprachbund

**Albanian shares features with neighboring languages** due to prolonged contact:

**Features acquired through contact:**
1. **Postposed definite article** (like Romanian, Bulgarian, Macedonian)
   - *libër* (book) → *libri* (the book) - article *-i* suffixed
   - Contrasts with most IE (article precedes noun)

2. **Loss of infinitive** (replaced by subjunctive constructions)
   - Like Modern Greek, Romanian, Bulgarian
   - Example: "I want to read" → "I want that I read"

3. **Evidential mood** (in some dialects)
   - Marking information source (witnessed vs. reported)
   - Shared with Bulgarian, Macedonian, Turkish

4. **Other shared features:**
   - Analytic future (with *do* "to want")
   - Numerals 11-19 formation pattern
   - Various syntactic calques

**Balkan Sprachbund members:**
- Albanian, Greek, Romanian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian (some dialects)
- Not genetic relationship, but areal diffusion

---

#### Case System

**5 cases:**
1. **Nominative** - subject
2. **Accusative** - direct object
3. **Genitive** - possession
4. **Dative** - indirect object
5. **Ablative** - source, separation, cause

**Partially merged:**
- Nominative and accusative often identical (except in pronouns and some nouns)
- Genitive and dative often identical
- Ablative distinct

**Definiteness marking:**
- Cases interact with definiteness (definite forms differ from indefinite)
- Postposed article modifies case endings
- Example:
  - *libër* (book, nom.indef) → *librin* (book, acc.def with article)

---

### 4.2 Translation Implications

**Balkan features:**
- May aid in certain constructions (subjunctive for infinitive, analytic future)
- Shared with Greek (both Balkan Sprachbund members)
- Could provide natural parallels for some Greek constructions

**Definite article:**
- Helps with Greek article translation
- But postposed (follows noun) unlike Greek preposed article
- Can handle Greek definiteness marking

**Relatively small translation base:**
- Limited research on Albanian Bible translations
- Only Tosk dialect in dataset (Gheg dialect not represented)
- Less studied than major branches

**Unique challenges:**
- Isolate branch means no closely related languages for comparison
- Balkan contact features may not align with Greek source features (even though both are Balkan)

---

## 5. Armenian Branch

**Modern languages in dataset:** None

**Note:** Armenian Bible translations exist but not in current dataset. Included here for completeness.

### 5.1 Key Features (for reference)

#### Isolate Branch
- Only surviving member of its branch (like Albanian)
- No closely related languages within IE family

#### Graeco-Armenian Hypothesis

**Proposed close relationship with Greek:**
- Pedersen (1924) proposed Graeco-Armenian as genetic subgroup
- Many shared lexical innovations
- Shared morphological features

**Modern scholarly consensus:**
- Largely rejected as genetic relationship
- More likely areal contact in Balkans/Anatolia
- Shared features due to proximity and contact, not common ancestry

**Source:**
- Wikipedia. "Graeco-Armenian"

---

#### Consonant Shift

**Armenian underwent chain shift of stop consonants:**
- Similar to Germanic (Grimm's Law), but independent
- Pattern: *bh → b, b → p, p → f* (simplified)

**Example:**
- PIE *\*pəter-* → Armenian *hayr* "father" (initial *p* → *h*, later lost)
- PIE *\*bʰreh₂ter-* → Armenian *ełbayr* "brother"

**Significance:**
- Shows parallel development to Germanic
- But independently innovated (not shared change)
- Demonstrates convergent evolution in IE branches

**Source:**
- Cambridge University Press. "Armenian (Chapter 12) - The Indo-European Language Family"

---

#### Other Features

**Case system:** 7 cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, ablative, instrumental, locative)

**Gender:** No grammatical gender (lost entirely)

**Verb system:** Complex, with multiple conjugations and synthetic tense/aspect forms

**Writing system:** Unique Armenian alphabet (created 5th century CE by Mesrop Mashtots)

---

### 5.2 Translation Implications (Hypothetical)

**No gender:**
- Like Persian, avoids forced gender assignment
- Simplifies translation of Greek neuter terms

**Case system:**
- 7 cases would allow expression of Greek case nuances
- Could match Greek complexity

**No Armenian in dataset:**
- Cannot analyze actual translation patterns
- Historical Armenian Bible translation is important (5th century CE)
- Classical Armenian (Grabar) is liturgical language

---

## 6. Baltic Branch

**Modern languages in dataset:** Lithuanian

**Note:** Latvian not in current dataset but is closely related

### 6.1 Key Features

#### Extreme Conservatism

**Quote from sources:** **"Among the most conservative of currently remaining Indo-European languages"**

**Lithuanian especially conservative in:**
1. **Sound system:** Pitch accent preserved from PIE
2. **Noun morphology:** Case system very archaic
3. **Case system:** 7 cases maintained

**Why so conservative?**
- Geographic isolation (Baltic region)
- Late contact with other IE languages
- Not written until 16th century (preserved archaic forms longer)
- Small speech community maintained stability

**Sources:**
- ScienceDirect. "Baltic Languages"
- Britannica. "Baltic languages - Slavic, Indo-European, Baltic-Slavic"

---

#### Case System

**7 cases:**
1. **Nominative**
2. **Genitive**
3. **Dative**
4. **Accusative**
5. **Instrumental**
6. **Locative**
7. **Vocative**

**Maintains fuller case system than most IE languages**

**Complexity:**
- Multiple declension classes
- Preserves distinctions lost in other languages
- Case endings often more conservative than Slavic

---

#### Tonal Accent

**Lithuanian preserves PIE pitch accent system:**
- Free accent (can fall on any syllable)
- Tonal distinctions (rising vs. falling pitch)
- One of very few IE languages to preserve this

**Other IE languages with tone/pitch accent:**
- **Serbo-Croatian:** Preserves pitch accent (also highly conservative)
- **Swedish/Norwegian:** Developed tonal accent independently (not inherited from PIE)

**Most IE languages:** Shifted to stress accent (loudness) instead of pitch

**Significance for historical linguistics:**
- Provides evidence for PIE accent system
- Helps reconstruct PIE phonology
- Matches Sanskrit accent system in many respects

---

### 6.2 Translation Implications

**Archaic features:**
- Provide insights into earlier IE stages
- Lithuanian can serve as "window" into PIE structure
- Useful for understanding ancient IE languages (Sanskrit, Greek, Latin)

**Rich case system:**
- Matches Greek complexity (7 vs. 5 cases)
- Can express Greek case nuances
- More distinctions than Greek in some areas

**Limited translation base:**
- Only one Baltic language in dataset (Lithuanian)
- Latvian not represented
- Smaller research base than Slavic, Germanic, Romance

**Similarity to Slavic:**
- Balto-Slavic relationship means Lithuanian shares features with Slavic
- Can inform Slavic translation analysis
- Some argue for Balto-Slavic unity (single branch), others for separate branches

**Overall:**
- Highly conservative grammar matches ancient source languages well
- But limited representation and small language community

---

## 7. Romani Branch

**Modern languages in dataset:** Romani (Carpathian, Vlax dialects)

### 7.1 Key Features

#### Indo-Aryan Origin

**Descended from medieval Indo-Aryan languages of northwestern India**
- Related to Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati
- Left Indian subcontinent approximately 1000-1200 CE ({wiki-romani-history}: "migrations to Europe occurring approximately 1000 years ago"; {worldatlas-romani}: "arrived in the Balkans around 900 years ago")
- Migrated through Persia, Armenia, into Europe

**Evidence of Indo-Aryan origin:**
- Core vocabulary is Indo-Aryan
- Grammatical structure reflects Indo-Aryan patterns
- Not Iranian (despite passing through Iran)

**Relationship within Indo-Iranian:**
- Closest to northwestern Indo-Aryan languages
- Shares features with Punjabi, Gujarati
- Diverged before many modern Indo-Aryan innovations

---

#### European Influences

**Extensive borrowing from contact languages:**
- **Greek loans** (from Byzantine period)
- **Slavic loans** (from Eastern European contact)
- **Romance loans** (from Western European contact)
- **Germanic loans** (from Central European contact)

**Grammatical simplification in some dialects:**
- Case system variability (some dialects more, some less)
- Influence of contact languages on syntax
- Lexical borrowing can exceed 50% in some dialects

**Dialectal diversity:**
- Hundreds of dialects
- Classified into groups: Balkan, Vlax, Central, Northern, etc.
- Mutual intelligibility varies
- Different European influences by region

---

#### Case System Variation

**Varies by dialect:**

**More conservative dialects:** 6-8 cases
- Similar to Indo-Aryan case systems
- Maintain Indo-Aryan oblique case + postpositions
- Layer system: direct case + oblique + postpositions

**More simplified dialects:** 3-4 cases
- Lost some Indo-Aryan distinctions
- Influenced by contact languages

**European Romani typically:** 6-8 cases
- Direct case (nominative)
- Oblique case (genitive/dative/accusative merged)
- Vocative
- Plus various postpositional cases

**Note:** Romani case systems are Indo-Aryan derived, NOT developed from European contact

### 7.2 Translation Implications

**Small translation base:**
- Limited Biblical texts in Romani
- Romani Bible translation history is relatively recent ({wiki-romani-bible}: first Gospel in 1837, complete Bible not until 2014)
- Many Romani communities multilingual (use majority language for religious texts)

**Mixed grammar:**
- Reflects both Indo-Aryan inheritance and European influences
- Core structure is Indo-Aryan (case system, verb structure)
- Extensive lexical borrowing from European languages
- Syntax may show European influence

**Diaspora language:**
- High dialectal variation creates challenges
- No standard written form universally accepted
- Different dialects may require different translation approaches

**Indo-Aryan connection:**
- Shares some features with Hindi/Urdu translations
- May show similar patterns to Indo-Aryan Bible translation
- But centuries of separation and European contact make direct comparison complex

**Cultural considerations:**
- Translation must account for Romani cultural context
- Different from both Indian and European contexts
- Unique position as diasporic Indo-Aryan language in Europe

**Overall:**
- Unique case study of Indo-Aryan language in European context
- Limited data makes analysis difficult
- Potential for comparative study with both Indo-Aryan and European translations

## Summary: Branch Diversity

The remaining Indo-European branches show remarkable diversity:

**Indo-Iranian:** Largest branch, shows unique ergativity (Indo-Aryan) and gender loss (Iranian)

**Celtic:** Unique VSO order and consonant mutations "unknown in any other attested Indo-European language"

**Greek:** SOURCE language for NT; aspect-prominent system critical for all translations

**Albanian:** Isolate branch with Balkan Sprachbund features; postposed article

**Armenian:** Not in dataset; isolate branch with consonant shift parallel to Germanic

**Baltic:** Extremely conservative; "window" into PIE structure; pitch accent preserved

**Romani:** Diasporic Indo-Aryan in Europe; mixed grammar with extensive European borrowing

Each branch presents unique challenges and advantages for Bible translation based on its specific grammatical profile.
