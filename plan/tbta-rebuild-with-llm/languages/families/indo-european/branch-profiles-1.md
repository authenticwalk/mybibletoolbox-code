# Indo-European Branch Profiles: Part 1

This document covers the three largest and most well-studied Indo-European branches in our dataset: Germanic, Romance (Italic), and Slavic.

---

## 1. Germanic Branch

**Modern languages in dataset:** English, German, Dutch, Danish, Swedish

### 1.1 Key Features

#### Strong vs. Weak Verb Distinction

**Strong verbs:** Mark past tense by vowel change (ablaut)
- Inherited from PIE vowel gradation system
- Examples: *sing/sang/sung*, *drink/drank/drunk*, *drive/drove/driven*
- English has approximately 200 strong verbs ({wiki-irregular}: "many irregular verbs, approaching 200 in normal use")
- Gradually declining in number (some strong verbs becoming weak over time)

**Weak verbs:** Mark past tense with dental suffix
- Germanic innovation (not inherited from PIE)
- English: *-ed* suffix (*walk/walked*, *love/loved*)
- German: *-te* suffix (*machen/machte*, *sagen/sagte*)
- Most new verbs enter language as weak verbs
- Productive category (can create new weak verbs freely)

**Diachronic trend:** Strong verbs → weak verbs (e.g., *help* historically had *holp/holpen*, now *helped*)

#### Case System Simplification

**Old English case system:** 5 cases
1. Nominative
2. Accusative
3. Genitive
4. Dative
5. Instrumental (merged with dative later)

**Modern English:** Essentially caseless
- Only pronouns show case: *I/me*, *he/him*, *who/whom*
- Genitive survives in *'s* possessive: *John's book*
- Case marking lost from nouns and adjectives entirely

**German:** 4 cases preserved
1. Nominative (*der Mann* "the man")
2. Accusative (*den Mann* "the man" [object])
3. Dative (*dem Mann* "to the man")
4. Genitive (*des Mannes* "of the man")

**Scandinavian languages:** Largely lost case distinctions
- Swedish: 2 cases (nominative/genitive only, genitive marked by *-s*)
- Danish: 2 cases (similar to Swedish)
- Icelandic: 4 cases (conservative outlier, not in our dataset)

**Consequence of case loss:**
- Fixed word order required (SVO rigidly maintained in English)
- Expanded use of prepositions to mark grammatical relationships
- More analytic morphology (separate words instead of inflections)

---

#### V2 Word Order

**Verb-second (V2) constraint:** In main clauses, the finite verb must be the second constituent.

**Germanic languages with V2:**
- German
- Dutch
- Danish
- Swedish
- Yiddish
- Icelandic

**English:** Lost V2 in Middle English period
- Retains traces in questions: "What did you see?"
- Retains traces with negation fronting: "Never have I seen..."
- Otherwise uses rigid SVO

**Examples:**

German: "Heute gehe ich ins Kino" (Today go I to-the cinema)
- Topic (Heute) + Verb (gehe) + Subject (ich) + Rest

English: "Today I go to the cinema"
- Topic (Today) + Subject (I) + Verb (go) + Rest

**V2 significance:** Allows flexible topicalization while maintaining verb position

---

#### Tense-Prominent System

**Germanic focus:** Tense (time reference) is primary, aspect is secondary

**Contrast with Greek:** Greek emphasizes aspect (perfective/imperfective/stative), with tense being secondary

**Germanic tense systems:**

**English:**
- Simple: present, past
- Perfect: present perfect, past perfect, future perfect
- Progressive: present progressive, past progressive
- Perfect progressive: present perfect progressive, etc.

**Aspect in English:**
- Progressive aspect: *I am reading* (ongoing)
- Perfect aspect: *I have read* (completed with present relevance)
- Simple aspect: *I read* (habitual or simple fact)

**Problem:** English aspects don't map cleanly to Greek aspects
- Greek aorist = perfective aspect (complete action viewed as whole)
- English simple past conflates perfective and imperfective readings
- English progressive doesn't equal Greek imperfective (which can be habitual, not just ongoing)

**Developed analytic constructions:**
- Perfect: *have/has/had + past participle*
- Progressive: *be + present participle*
- Passive: *be + past participle*
- Replaced synthetic Latin/PIE constructions

---

### 1.2 Translation Implications

**Loss of case system:**
- Requires fixed word order → cannot vary word order for emphasis as Greek does
- Requires prepositions → Greek case alone can express relationships English needs prepositions for
- Cannot always distinguish Greek genitive vs. dative meanings

**Tense-based system:**
- Struggles with Greek aorist (aspectually perfective, not just past tense)
- English translators typically use simple past for aorist, losing aspectual nuance
- Example: Greek "ἐβάπτισεν" (baptized, aorist) vs. "ἐβάπτιζεν" (was baptizing, imperfect)
  - Both often translated "baptized" in English, losing the distinction

**Analytic nature:**
- Makes English relatively easy to translate *into* (flexible word order not required)
- Requires more words (separate articles, prepositions, auxiliaries)
- More interpretive decisions required (where to insert articles, which prepositions to use)

**English advantages:**
- Large vocabulary allows nuanced lexical distinctions
- Analytic constructions are transparent
- Global language with extensive translation resources

---

## 2. Romance Branch (Italic)

**Modern languages in dataset:** Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, Latin

### 2.1 Key Features

#### Dramatic Case Loss

**Latin case system:** 6-7 cases
1. Nominative (subject)
2. Accusative (direct object)
3. Genitive (possession)
4. Dative (indirect object)
5. Ablative (separation, means, location)
6. Vocative (address) - often identical to nominative
7. Locative (location) - rare, mostly obsolete in Classical Latin

**Modern Romance case systems:**

**Most Romance languages:** 0 cases
- Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese: No morphological case on nouns
- Case distinctions expressed through:
  - Word order (relatively fixed SVO)
  - Prepositions (*de* for genitive, *a* for dative, etc.)
  - Clitic pronouns (retain some case distinctions)

**Romanian:** 2 cases (unique among Romance)
- Nominative/Accusative vs. Genitive/Dative distinction
- Expressed through inflected definite articles, not noun endings
- Example: *om* (man-nom) vs. *omului* (man-gen/dat with article)

**Mechanism of case loss:**
- Phonological erosion of unstressed final syllables
- Loss of vowel length distinctions
- Collapse of case endings → reliance on word order and prepositions

- ResearchGate. "Why Do Languages Lose Grammatical Categories?: Latin and Romance Evidence"

---

#### Shift from Synthetic to Analytic

**Latin (synthetic):**
- *amāveram* = "I had loved" (single inflected word)
- 6 tenses × 2 aspects × 3 moods × 2 voices × 6 person/number combinations = 100+ forms per verb

**Romance (analytic):**
- *había amado* (Spanish) = "I had loved" (*había* = auxiliary + *amado* = participle)
- Separate auxiliary verbs + participles replace synthetic forms

**Developments:**
- **Articles:** Latin had no articles → Romance developed definite and indefinite articles
  - Spanish: *el/la* (def), *un/una* (indef)
  - French: *le/la* (def), *un/une* (indef)
- **Compound tenses:** *have/be + participle* constructions
- **Analytic passive:** *be + past participle* instead of Latin synthetic passive
- **Auxiliary verbs:** Modals and tense auxiliaries multiply

**Consequence:** More words, less morphology

---

#### Loss of Neuter Gender

**Latin gender system:** 3 genders
- Masculine: *dominus* (lord)
- Feminine: *domina* (lady)
- Neuter: *donum* (gift), *bellum* (war)

**Romance gender system:** 2 genders (in most languages)
- Masculine and feminine only
- Neuter merged with masculine in most words
- Neuter Latin plurals sometimes became feminine singulars:
  - Latin *folia* (neuter plural, "leaves") → Italian *foglia* (feminine singular, "leaf")

**Exception:** Romanian retains some neuter-like behavior
- Some nouns are masculine in singular, feminine in plural
- Not true neuter, but reflects Latin neuter plural patterns

**Translation significance:**
- Greek neuter nouns must be assigned masculine or feminine in Romance
- Example: πνεῦμα (*pneuma*, "spirit") is neuter in Greek
  - Spanish: *espíritu* (masculine)
  - French: *esprit* (masculine)
  - This gender assignment affected theological debates about Holy Spirit personhood

---

#### Verb System Complexity

**Despite case loss, Romance verbs remain complex:**

**Multiple past tenses:**
- **Preterite/Simple Past:** Completed action (*canté* "I sang" - Spanish)
- **Imperfect:** Ongoing or habitual past action (*cantaba* "I was singing/used to sing")
- **Present Perfect:** Recent past with present relevance (*he cantado* "I have sung")
- **Pluperfect:** Past before past (*había cantado* "I had sung")

**Mood system:**
- **Indicative:** Statement of fact
- **Subjunctive:** Doubt, possibility, desire, subordinate clauses
- **Conditional:** Hypothetical situations
- **Imperative:** Commands

**Subjunctive preservation:**
- Romance languages maintain robust subjunctive mood
- Triggered by verbs of doubt, desire, emotion, impersonal expressions
- Example (Spanish): *Quiero que vengas* "I want that you come (subj.)"

**Problem for Greek translation:**
- Multiple past tenses ≠ Greek aspect system
- Spanish *canté* (preterite) and *cantaba* (imperfect) both express past time
- But they don't align with Greek aorist vs. imperfect (which mark aspect, not just time)

---

#### Word Order Rigidification

**Latin word order:** Relatively free (SOV tendency, but flexible)
- Case endings indicate grammatical relationships
- Word order used for emphasis and style
- Example: *Puella puerum amat* = *Puerum puella amat* = "The girl loves the boy"

**Romance word order:** Rigid SVO
- Subject → Verb → Object order is fixed
- Cannot scramble for emphasis (unlike Greek)
- Emphasis achieved through:
  - Clefting: *Es Juan quien lo hizo* "It's John who did it"
  - Fronting with resumptive pronoun: *A Juan, lo vi* "John, I saw him"

**Consequence for translation:**
- Greek pragmatic word order variations cannot be reproduced
- Example: John 1:1 *θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος* (God was the Word) - fronted θεὸς emphasizes quality
- Romance must use "was God" (SVO) and cannot reproduce the emphasis

---

### 2.2 Translation Implications

**Need for articles:**
- Greek has definite article, no indefinite
- Hebrew has only definite prefix *ה*
- Romance requires both definite and indefinite articles
- Translators must decide when to insert articles not explicit in source

**Multiple past tenses:**
- Creates challenges distinguishing Greek aorist from perfect
- Spanish preterite ≠ aorist (though often used for it)
- French passé simple ≠ aorist (also rare in modern spoken French)

**Mandatory gender assignment:**
- Affects translation of gender-neutral Hebrew terms
- Forces binary gender on concepts that may not be gendered
- Theological implications for terms like *spirit*, *wisdom*, etc.

**Loss of case nuance:**
- Like English, cannot distinguish Greek genitive vs. dative by form alone
- Must use prepositions and context

**Advantages:**
- Rich mood systems (subjunctive especially) can capture some Greek modal distinctions
- Verb complexity allows nuanced temporal/aspectual expression
- Multiple past tenses provide some aspectual distinction (even if not aligned with Greek)

## 3. Slavic Branch (Balto-Slavic)

**Modern languages in dataset:** Russian, Polish, Czech, Belarusian, Ukrainian, Croatian, Serbian
**Also included:** Lithuanian (Baltic branch, closely related)

### 3.1 Key Features

#### Highly Conservative Case System

**Most Slavic languages: 7 cases**
1. Nominative (*именительный*, *mianownik*)
2. Genitive (*родительный*, *dopełniacz*)
3. Dative (*дательный*, *celownik*)
4. Accusative (*винительный*, *biernik*)
5. Instrumental (*творительный*, *narzędnik*)
6. Locative/Prepositional (*предложный*, *miejscownik*)
7. Vocative (*звательный*, *wołacz*)

**Russian: 6 cases**
- No distinct vocative (merged with nominative)
- "Prepositional" case instead of "locative" (always used with prepositions)

**Case usage examples (Russian):**
- Nominative: *студент* (student - subject)
- Genitive: *студента* (of student - possession, absence)
- Dative: *студенту* (to student - indirect object)
- Accusative: *студента* (student - direct object, animate masculine)
- Instrumental: *студентом* (with/by student - instrument, means)
- Prepositional: *о студенте* (about student - always with preposition)

**Complexity multiplied:**
- 3 genders × 7 cases × 2 numbers = 42 potential forms per noun
- Adjectives also inflect for case, gender, number
- Among most conservative IE languages for preserving complex morphology

- MasterRussian.com. "Cases of Russian Nouns"
- Study-Languages-Online.com. "Russian Cases"

---

#### Aspect-Prominent System

**Most distinctive feature of Slavic:** Aspect is MORE important than tense

**Perfective/Imperfective distinction:**
- **Perfective:** Action viewed as complete whole, completed, or one-time
- **Imperfective:** Action viewed as ongoing, habitual, or incomplete

**Morphological marking:**
- **Unique in IE:** Slavic uses **prefixes** to mark aspect
- Also uses suffixes and stem alternations
- Almost all verbs come in perfective/imperfective pairs

**Examples (Russian):**

| Imperfective | Perfective | Meaning |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| читать (čitat') | прочитать (pročitat') | to read |
| писать (pisat') | написать (napisat') | to write |
| делать (delat') | сделать (sdelat') | to do/make |
| говорить (govorit') | сказать (skazat') | to speak/say |

**Prefix addition creates perfective:**
- *читать* → *про-читать* (prefix *про-* adds completeness)
- *писать* → *на-писать* (prefix *на-* adds completion)

**Aspectual pairs are unpredictable:**
- Sometimes prefix: *делать/сделать*
- Sometimes different roots: *говорить/сказать*
- Sometimes suffix: *решать/решить*

**Only subfamily of IE that uses prefixes to mark aspect** - this is a Slavic innovation

**Tense forms by aspect:**

**Imperfective verbs:**
- Past tense: *читал* "was reading, used to read, read (habitually)"
- Present tense: *читаю* "I read, I am reading"
- Future tense: *буду читать* "I will read, I will be reading" (compound)

**Perfective verbs:**
- Past tense: *прочитал* "read (completely), finished reading"
- No present tense (perfective aspect incompatible with present time reference)
- Future tense: *прочитаю* "I will read (completely)" (simple form)

**Translation of Greek:**
- **Greek aorist** (perfective aspect) → Slavic perfective past
- **Greek imperfect** (imperfective aspect) → Slavic imperfective past
- **Greek present** (imperfective aspect) → Slavic imperfective present

**Perfect match:** Slavic aspectual system aligns with Greek better than any other IE branch

- Russian Linguistics. "The typology of Slavic aspect: a review of the East-West Theory" (2015)
- Wiemer & Serzant. "Diachrony and typology of Slavic aspect" (2017)

#### Dual Number (Limited Preservation)

**Preserved in only 4 Slavic languages:**
1. **Slovene** - Full productive dual system
2. **Upper Sorbian** - Full productive dual system
3. **Lower Sorbian** - Full productive dual system
4. **Kashubian** - Full productive dual system

**Morphological marking:**
- Upper/Lower Sorbian add *-j* to dual forms
- Slovene adds *'dva'* (two) to inherited dual pronouns

**Usage:**
- Mandatory when referring to exactly two entities
- Nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and verbs all have dual forms
- Examples (Slovene):
  - *en človek* (one person) - singular
  - *dva človeka* (two persons) - dual
  - *trije ljudje* (three persons) - plural

**Significance:**
- Quote from sources: "Arabic, Slovene, and the two Sorbian languages" are the most morphologically rich in dual systems
- Greek NT has occasional dual forms
- Only these Slavic languages can preserve the dual distinction in translation

**Problem:** None of these four languages are in our current dataset
- Dataset includes Russian, Polish, Czech, Ukrainian, etc. (no dual)
- Missing the four dual-preserving languages

**Sources:**
- Springer. "Slovene Nouns and Adjectives: Non-Standard Use of Dual Number"
- CEEOL linguistic database

---

#### Gender Complexity

**3 genders fully preserved:**
- Masculine
- Feminine
- Neuter

**Russian: 6 gender classes**
- 3 grammatical genders × animate/inanimate distinction
- Animate masculine accusative = genitive (*вижу студента* "I see student")
- Inanimate masculine accusative = nominative (*вижу стол* "I see table")

**Polish: Even more complex**
- Masculine has **three subgenders** in plural:
  1. **Masculine personal** (male humans): *studenci* (students-masc.pers)
  2. **Masculine animate** (male animals): *psy* (dogs)
  3. **Masculine inanimate** (objects): *stoły* (tables)
- Feminine and neuter less complex

**Consequence:**
- Matches Greek 3-gender system perfectly
- Can translate Greek gender distinctions without forced choices
- Neuter preserved for neuter Greek terms (πνεῦμα → neuter in Slavic)

---

#### Free Word Order

**Extensive case system allows flexible word order:**
- Case endings indicate grammatical relationships
- Word order determined by:
  - Pragmatics (topic/comment structure)
  - Information structure (given/new information)
  - Emphasis and focus

**Basic tendency:** SVO, but highly flexible

**Examples (Russian):**
- *Студент читает книгу* (Student reads book) - SVO, neutral
- *Книгу читает студент* (Book reads student) - OVS, book emphasized
- *Читает студент книгу* (Reads student book) - VSO, verb emphasized

**Contrast with English:**
- English: *The student reads the book* (fixed SVO)
- Cannot reorder without changing meaning or creating ungrammaticality

**Translation advantage:**
- Can match Greek pragmatic word order
- Greek also uses word order for emphasis
- Example: John 1:1 *θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος* - Slavic can reproduce fronted θεὸς

---

### 3.2 Translation Implications

**Aspect is critical:**
- Slavic can easily distinguish Greek perfective (aorist) vs. imperfective aspect
- Example: Matthew 3:13 *παραγίνεται* (present, imperfective) vs. *ἐγένετο* (aorist, perfective)
  - Russian can use imperfective *приходит* vs. perfective *пришёл*
  - English typically uses simple past for both, losing distinction

**Rich case system:**
- Closely matches Greek case system
- Can express nuances English cannot
- Example: Greek genitive has multiple functions (possession, source, partitive, etc.)
  - Russian genitive can express all of these directly
  - English must use different prepositions or constructions

**No articles:**
- More similar to Hebrew/Greek article usage than English
- Greek has definite article; Slavic lacks articles
- Translators must decide when Greek article indicates definiteness vs. other functions
- Avoids over-specification (English forces article insertion)

**Dual number (in some languages not in dataset):**
- Slovene, Upper/Lower Sorbian, Kashubian match Greek NT dual forms
- Example: Luke 24:13 "two of them" - Greek uses dual, Slovene can preserve this

**Free word order:**
- Can match Greek word order variations
- Preserves emphasis patterns English loses
- Example: Romans 8:31 *εἰ ὁ θεὸς ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν* (if God for us) - fronted *θεὸς* for emphasis
  - Slavic can front "Бог" (God) to match
  - English must use "if God is for us" (fixed word order)

**Gender preservation:**
- Neuter gender preserved for Greek neuter terms
- πνεῦμα (spirit, neuter) → Russian *дух* (masculine) - but Slavic HAS neuter, could use neuter term if chosen
- Actually most Slavic languages use masculine for "spirit" (historical choice, not grammatical necessity)

**Challenges:**
- Aspect is NOT identical to Greek (Slavic aspect more grammaticalized)
- Case meanings don't always align perfectly
- Slavic languages developed innovations Greek lacks (e.g., aspect prefixes)

**Overall assessment:**
- **Slavic languages are among the best matches for Greek grammar** in the IE family
- Can preserve distinctions that English, Romance, and Germanic languages lose
- Conservative morphology and aspect-prominence make Slavic translations structurally closer to Greek
