# Language Family Research for Bible Translation

Consolidated research on major language families represented in Bible translations, focusing on grammatical features that affect translation decisions.

**Coverage**: 6 major families with detailed analyses, plus 70+ additional families documented in other-families.md

## Austronesian (172 languages)

The world's most geographically dispersed language family, spanning from Madagascar to Easter Island. Major concentration in Papua New Guinea (87 languages), Philippines (45 languages), and Indonesia (18 languages).

**Critical features for translation**:
- **Symmetrical voice systems**: Philippine-type languages retain 4-voice systems (actor, patient, locative, instrumental). Translators must analyze information structure to select appropriate voice marking.
- **Inclusive/exclusive pronouns**: Nearly universal distinction in first-person plural. Critical for passages with ambiguous "we" (e.g., Paul's letters - does "we" include addressees?).
- **Realis/irrealis mood**: Primary organizing principle for tense-aspect-mood. Greek aorist/present don't map directly; requires careful modal analysis.
- **Possessive classification**: Inalienable (body parts, kinship) vs. alienable possession marked differently. Affects theological language ("our Father" vs. "our possessions").

**Word order**: Philippine-type VSO/VOS, Indonesian-type SVO, Oceanic mostly SVO (except Polynesian VSO).

**Key insight**: Voice selection must follow natural information flow, not mechanical rules. Patient voice often predominates in narrative (60-70%).

## Indo-European (123 languages)

The most widely studied language family, with extensive documentation for major translation traditions (Greek, Latin, Germanic, Slavic, Celtic, Indo-Aryan).

**Critical features for translation**:
- **Gender systems**: 2-3 grammatical genders affect agreement. Greek/Hebrew gender categories may not align with target language.
- **Case systems**: Range from minimal (English) to extensive (Russian 6 cases, Sanskrit 8 cases). Affects how semantic roles are expressed.
- **Aspect distinctions**: Slavic perfective/imperfective provides excellent models for understanding Greek aspect. Not simple past/present tense.
- **Verb-second (V2) constraint**: Germanic languages place finite verb in second position. Affects clause structure in narrative.

**Word order**: Highly variable (SVO, SOV, VSO, V2) depending on branch.

**Key insight**: Indo-European diversity means no single "European" translation model exists. Celtic ergative patterns differ dramatically from Germanic case systems.

## Niger-Congo (98 languages)

Africa's largest language family, primarily represented by Bantu branch in Bible translations. Notable for elaborate noun class systems and tonal complexity.

**Critical features for translation**:
- **Noun class systems**: 10-20 classes with full concordial agreement. Each class has semantic properties (human, animate, diminutive, augmentative, etc.).
- **Tone**: Lexical and grammatical. Tone changes can indicate tense, aspect, or negation. Critical for meaning but often absent in writing systems.
- **Serial verb constructions**: Multiple verbs in sequence without conjunctions. Affects how motion + action are expressed ("go get" as two verbs).
- **Agentless constructions**: Passive-like structures without explicit passive morphology. Important for divine passive.

**Word order**: Predominantly SVO with extensive use of particles for tense-aspect-mood.

**Key insight**: Noun class assignment affects how abstract concepts are categorized. "Word" might be in abstract class vs. speech class depending on theological interpretation.

## Trans-New Guinea (127 languages)

The world's third-largest language family (by number of languages), concentrated in Papua New Guinea highlands. Characterized by extreme diversity due to geographic isolation.

**Critical features for translation**:
- **Switch reference**: Medial verbs marked for whether next clause has same or different subject. Critical for tracking participants in narrative.
- **Evidentiality**: Some languages mark information source (visual, reported, inferred). Affects how testimonial passages are translated.
- **Complex verb morphology**: Subject/object agreement, tense/aspect, mood, directional markers all on verb. Single verb word can be entire clause.
- **SOV word order**: Nearly universal. Verb-final structure with extensive clause chaining.

**Key insight**: Switch reference systems provide natural mechanisms for participant tracking that English lacks. Narrative coherence maintained through verb morphology, not pronouns.

## Mayan (22 languages)

Mesoamerican family spanning Guatemala and southern Mexico. All languages have Bible translations. Ancient writing system provides comparative data.

**Critical features for translation**:
- **Ergative-absolutive alignment**: Intransitive subjects marked like transitive objects, not like transitive subjects. Fundamentally different from nominative-accusative systems.
- **Numeral classifiers**: Extensive systems categorizing objects by shape, function, and abstract properties. Affects how quantities are expressed.
- **Positional verbs**: Distinct category expressing position, posture, or shape of objects at rest. Critical for spatial descriptions in narrative.
- **Aspect-based system**: Primary distinction is perfective/imperfective, not past/present/future.

**Word order**: VSO or VOS (verb-initial).

**Key insight**: Ergative alignment affects passive constructions and causatives. Greek passive may require different strategies than in accusative languages.

## Otomanguean (69 languages)

The oldest language family in the Americas (proto-language ~4400 BCE), concentrated in Oaxaca, Mexico. Only fully tonal family in North/Central America.

**Critical features for translation**:
- **Universal tonality**: All 69 languages are tonal. Tone distinguishes both lexical meaning and grammatical categories. Some varieties have 5 level tones.
- **VSO word order**: Verb-initial structure head-initial.
- **Complex inflection**: Incredibly complex systems involving tone, affixes, stem changes all simultaneously. Some of the most complex inflection systems in the world.
- **Whistled speech**: Zapotec, Chinantec, and Mazatec can be whistled, reproducing tone and rhythm.

**Key insight**: Tone marking is non-negotiable for written materials. Tone changes encode grammatical information that cannot be omitted.

## Usage Guidelines

### For Tool Developers
1. **Feature-specific tools**: Reference family documentation for linguistic context
2. **Cross-family validation**: Test tools on typologically diverse families
3. **Document assumptions**: Note which alignment/voice/TAM system your tool assumes

### For Translators
1. **Source analysis**: Understand source language features (Greek aspect, Hebrew voice)
2. **Target mapping**: Identify target language's alignment, TAM, and pronoun systems
3. **Natural patterns**: Follow target language discourse norms, not source syntax

### For Researchers
1. **Typological coverage**: Ensure research includes diverse structural types
2. **Feature interaction**: Document how multiple features interact (e.g., ergativity + switch-reference)
3. **Update documentation**: Contribute findings back to family files
