# Unique Linguistic Features of Austronesian Languages

This document details the distinctive grammatical features found across Austronesian languages that are particularly relevant for Bible translation.

## Symmetrical Voice / Austronesian Alignment

**Definition**: "A typologically unusual kind of morphosyntactic alignment in which one argument can be marked as having a special relationship to the verb" [Wikipedia: Symmetrical Voice]

**How It Works**: Voice affixes on the verb correspond to the syntactic role of a noun that is either case-marked or found in a privileged structural position.

### Two Major Types

#### Philippine-Type (Retained in Taiwan, Philippines, N. Borneo, N. Sulawesi, Madagascar)

**Four voices reconstructed for Proto-Austronesian**:

1. **Actor Voice** (*-um-): Focuses on the agent/doer
2. **Patient Voice** (*-en): Focuses on the object/patient
3. **Locative Voice** (*-an): Focuses on the location
4. **Instrument/Benefactive Voice** (*Si-): Focuses on instrument or beneficiary

**Example** (Tagalog):
- Future tense shows reduplication: *l-um-akad* 'walk' → *la-lakad* 'will walk'
- Voice determines which semantic role expresses the "subject"/"topic"

**Translation Implication**: A single Greek or Hebrew verb might need to be translated differently depending on what element is being focused. For instance, "Jesus healed the man" could be expressed as:
- Actor focus: "Jesus is-the-one-who-healed the man"
- Patient focus: "The man is-the-one-who-was-healed by Jesus"
- Locative focus: "The place is-where Jesus-healed the man"
- Instrument focus: "The power is-what Jesus-used-to-heal the man"

#### Indonesian-Type (Most other Austronesian languages)

- **Two voices**: Reduced from original four
- **Simpler system**: Still present but less elaborate than Philippine-type

**Scholarly Sources**:
- Schachter and colleagues proposed the term "trigger" to explain verb-noun relationships in Philippine languages [Source: Schachter & Otanes 1972, Schachter 1976]
- Recent scholarship prefers "voice" over older term "focus"
- Edith Aldridge (2016): "Ergativity from Subjunctive in Austronesian Languages"

## Person and Pronoun Systems

### Inclusive/Exclusive Distinction

**Definition**: First person plural distinguishes between inclusive 'we' (includes addressee) and exclusive 'we' (excludes addressee)

**Distribution**: "Almost all Austronesian languages distinguish two forms of 'we'" [WALS Online: Chapter 39]

**Examples**:

**Tagalog**:
- *kami* = exclusive 'we' (me and others, but not you)
- *tayo* = inclusive 'we' (me and you)

**Chamorro**:
- *hu* = 'I'
- *in* = exclusive 'we'
- *ta* = inclusive 'we'

**Special Features**:
- Many Philippine languages have a **dual inclusive** ('you and me' specifically) [Source: Tagalog kata/kitá, documented in Tagalog UD and Wikipedia: Clusivity]
- Some Oceanic languages distinguish **dual number** ('we two', 'you two', 'the two of them')
- **Trial or paucal marking** occurs in some Oceanic languages (indicating small groups)

**Translation Implication**: Critical for translating passages where the scope of "we" matters:
- Acts 16:10 ("God had called **us** to preach") - does this include the reader/audience?
- Ephesians 1:3-14 - multiple uses of "we/us/our" may need inclusive vs. exclusive distinction
- Narrative passages where disciples say "we" - does it include the person they're speaking to?

**Source**: [WALS Online: Inclusive/Exclusive Distinction in Independent Pronouns]

### Number Distinctions

Beyond singular and plural, many Austronesian languages mark:
- **Dual**: Exactly two individuals
- **Trial**: Three individuals (some Oceanic languages)
- **Paucal**: A few individuals (some Oceanic languages)

## Verb Systems: Realis/Irrealis Mood

**Definition**: "The realis-irrealis modal distinction is the major dichotomy in the Austronesian T-A-M system, and all other tense or aspect distinction are secondary elaborations added to it" [Irrealis is Real, PDF]

### Realis Mood

- **Meaning**: Events that are happening or have already happened
- **Aspectual distinctions**:
  - Perfective/Past: default past meaning
  - Imperfective/Present: present meaning

### Irrealis Mood

- **Meaning**: Events that have not yet happened, hypothetical situations, wishes, commands
- **Functions**: Future, hypothetical, conditional, imperative

### Examples

**Bikol** (Philippines):
- Realis prefix: *nag-* (both perfective/past and progressive/present)
- Irrealis prefix: *mag-* (future, commands, hypothetical)

**Vanuatu languages**: "Tense/modus/aspect marking in the Austronesian languages of Vanuatu is centered around a realis / irrealis distinction" [Source: Multiple academic sources including research on Nafsan, Daakie, and other Vanuatu languages]

**Translation Implication**:
- Greek aorist vs. present tense may not map directly to Austronesian realis/irrealis
- Imperatives and prohibitions require irrealis
- Prophetic passages may require careful modal marking
- Conditional statements ("if...then") require irrealis in protasis

**Historical Note**: Proto-Austronesian was accusative, but "the non-accusative alignment found in other Austronesian languages resulted first from the reanalysis of irrealis clause types" [Cambridge: Realis and Irrealis]

## Morphological Processes

### Reduplication

**Definition**: Repetition of all or part of a word to express grammatical or semantic meaning

**Frequency**: "Very common throughout Austronesian" [WALS Online: Chapter 27]

**Types**:

#### 1. CV Reduplication (consonant + vowel)
Very common in Austronesian

#### 2. Partial Reduplication
- **Function**: Future tense marking
- **Example** (Tagalog): *l-um-akad* 'walk' → *la-lakad* 'will walk'
- **Example** (Rukai, Taiwan): Same pattern for future tense [Source: Academic research on Rukai future tense; partial reduplication of verb stem marks future]

#### 3. Full Reduplication
- **Function**: Plurality of nouns
- **Example** (Bahasa Indonesia): *anak* 'child' → *anak anak* 'children'

#### 4. Ca-Reduplication
- **Function**: Derives cardinal numerals for counting humans from non-human numerals [Source: Proto-Austronesian reconstruction; found in Thao, Puyuma, Yami, Chamorro]

#### 5. Affix-Triggered Reduplication
- Each affix has an associated reduplication pattern [Source: Lopez 1950 "Reduplication in Tagalog"; MAG-Tagalog morphological analyzer research]
- Found in Tagalog and other Philippine languages
- "Reduplication accompanies affixation and has been described as affix-triggered reduplication"

**Translation Implication**:
- Hebrew plural concepts may be expressed through reduplication rather than suffixes
- Intensification and repetition in source texts may have natural reduplicative equivalents
- Distributive meanings ("each one") may use reduplication

### Affixation

**Scope**: "The Austronesian languages of Taiwan, the Philippines, northern Borneo, and Sulawesi and some other languages are characterized by a very rich morphology, which functions in both verb-forming and noun-forming processes" [Britannica: Morphology and Canonical Shape]

**Types**:
- **Prefixing**: *-um-* (actor focus), *ma-* (stative)
- **Suffixing**: *-en* (patient focus), *-an* (locative focus)
- **Circumfixing**: Both prefix and suffix simultaneously
- **Infixing**: Inserted into root (*um* in *l-um-akad*)

**Interaction with Syntax**: "Morphology and syntax are often hard to separate in the Austronesian languages, particularly the Philippine languages. This is because the morphology of the verbs often affects how the rest of the sentence would be constructed (i.e., syntax)." [Source: Kroeger dissertation on Tagalog; multiple Philippine linguistics sources]

**Contrast**:
- **Rich morphology**: Formosan, Philippine, northern Bornean, Sulawesi languages
- **Minimal inflection**: Western Indonesian languages (Malay, Indonesian, Javanese)
  - "Nouns and verbs have no inflections at all"
  - "Malay has no inflections for tense or case"

## Noun Systems

### Possessive Classification

**Inalienable vs. Alienable Possession** (especially in Oceanic languages):

#### Inalienable Possession
- **Categories**: Body parts, kinship terms, spiritual aspects (shadows, names)
- **Marking**: Possessive pronoun suffixed directly to noun
- **Example** (Fijian): *na mata-na* 'his eye'

#### Alienable Possession
- **Categories**: Objects that can be separated from possessor
- **Marking**: Possessive pronoun suffixed to a preposed classifying particle
- **Function**: Classifier specifies the relationship between possessed and possessor

**Alternative Terminology**:
- "Direct vs. indirect possession" (more common)
- Direct possession ≈ inalienable possession

**Micronesian Elaboration**:
- Complex classification systems for possession
- Categories for 'food', 'drink', 'general'
- Encoded by freestanding expressions indexed for person and number

**Source**: [WALS Online: Possessive Classification; Britannica: Austronesian Pronouns]

### Noun Classifiers

**Function**: Classifiers used when nouns are modified by numbers

**Example** (Malay):
- *orang* for humans
- *ekor* for animals
- *buah* for inanimate objects

**Genitive/Possessive Classifiers**:
- Special closed class of nouns
- Take pronominal possessive marking and nominal dependents
- Also labeled as 'relational' or 'attributive' classifiers

**Source**: [Chen & Polinsky: Gender Distinctions and Classifiers in Austronesian Languages]

### Case Marking and Definiteness

#### Philippine-Type Languages
- **Ang-phrase**: Focused common nouns preceded by *ang*
- **Semantic**: "Focused noun phrases are definite, or old information, while nonfocused noun phrases may be either definite or indefinite" [Britannica: Structural Characteristics]
- **Function**: Case roles of subjects marked by focus affixes on verb
- **Overlap**: "Nonsubject actors and possessors are marked in the same way"

#### Demonstratives as Definiteness Markers
- Many Austronesian languages lack dedicated articles
- Demonstratives serve dual function: deictic and definite marking
- **Example**: Nêlêmwa (New Caledonia) "has no (in)definite articles; definiteness is optionally marked by deictic or anaphoric demonstratives" [Source: Bril, I. research on Nêlêmwa number and numeration systems]

#### Manobo Languages (Philippines)
- Demonstratives used more extensively than in Tagalog
- "Convey definiteness, rather than their traditional deictic and pragmatic meanings - seemingly to compensate for the lost contrast of the determiners" [Source: Delmer, J.-F. "Non-Personal Determiners in Manobo Languages", Academia.edu]

**Word Order**:
- NGen order (noun-genitive) predominates in Austronesian languages
- Possessor follows possessed noun

**Translation Implication**:
- Greek article system (definite vs. anaphoric uses) needs careful analysis
- Hebrew definite article may require demonstrative + noun constructions
- Information structure (old vs. new information) interacts with case/voice marking

**Source**: [WALS: Definite Articles; Academia.edu: Non-Personal Determiners in Manobo Languages]

## Verb Categories: Stative vs. Dynamic

### Stative Verbs
- **Meaning**: Express states rather than actions
- **English equivalents**: Often translate as adjectives
- **Examples**: 'to be afraid', 'to be sick/painful', 'to be new', 'to sleep/to be asleep', color terms
- **Morphology**: Can take the prefix *ma-* in some languages [Source: Tagalog grammar; ma- forms adjectives/statives from nouns]
- **Translation implication**: Greek/Hebrew adjectives may be verbs in Austronesian

### Dynamic Verbs
- **Meaning**: Express actions and events
- **Morphology**: More complex affixation systems
- **Features**: Participate in voice/focus systems

**Source**: [Britannica: Structural Characteristics of Austronesian Languages]

## Word Order Patterns

**Summary by Region**:
- **Formosan & Philippine**: VSO or VOS (verb-initial)
- **Western Indonesia**: SVO (Malay, Javanese, Balinese)
- **Eastern Indonesia & Pacific**: Predominantly SVO
  - **Exceptions**:
    - Coastal New Guinea: SOV (Papuan influence)
    - Polynesian & Fijian: VSO
- **Some languages** (Thao, Saisiyat): Adopted SVO through contact with Taiwanese/Chinese [Source: Research on Formosan languages; Thao influenced by Mandarin Chinese and Taiwanese Minnan]

**Translation Implication**:
- Biblical Hebrew (VSO) and Greek (SVO/flexible) have different natural equivalents
- Verb-initial languages may naturally follow Hebrew narrative style
- Topic-comment structure in Greek may align well with Philippine focus systems

**Source**: [Britannica: Structural Characteristics; Wikipedia: Austronesian Languages]

## Phonological Features

**Typical Characteristics**:
- **Small phonemic inventories**
- **Lack of consonant clusters** (in most languages)
  - **Exception**: Formosan languages (especially Tsou, Atayal) have complex clusters
- **Five-vowel system** (/i/, /e/, /a/, /o/, /u/)
- **Generally toneless** (except through contact)

### Polynesian Distinctives
- "Scarcity of consonants"
- "Heavy use of vowels, distinguishing long and short forms"
- Long vowels are phonemically distinct

### Micronesian Distinctives
- "Lack of plain labial consonants" [Source: Wikipedia: Micronesian languages; similar to New Caledonian languages]
- Two series: palatalized and labio-velarized labials

### Cebuano (Representative Philippine Language)
- 16 consonantal sounds: /p, t, k, b, d, g, m, n, ng, s, h, ', l, r, w, y/ [Source: Cebuano phonology research, ScholarSpace UH]
- Three vowel phonemes: /i, a, u/ [Source: Cebuano phonology; native inventory before Spanish contact]
- /e, o/ occur in Spanish loanwords [Source: Spanish loanwords introduced marginal phonemes /e, o/ to Cebuano]

**Stress Patterns**:
- **Formosan**: Final or penultimate syllable
- **Varies by language family**
