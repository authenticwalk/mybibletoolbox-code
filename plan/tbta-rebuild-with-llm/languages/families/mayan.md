# Mayan Languages Documentation

## Overview

The Mayan language family comprises approximately 30 distinct languages total [Wikipedia: Mayan languages], with 22 Mayan languages spoken in Guatemala [Wikipedia: Languages of Guatemala]. These languages (with numerous dialects) are spoken across Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize. These languages represent one of the most significant indigenous language families of Mesoamerica, with a combined speaker population of approximately 6-7 million people [Wikipedia: Mayan languages; "more than six million people, though some sources estimate about 7 million"].

## Complete Mayan Language Database

## TBTA Translation Features

Features unique to Mayan languages that require translation decisions not explicit in Greek/Hebrew source texts.

### Numeral Classifiers - ESSENTIAL (All 22 languages)

**Present in**: All Mayan languages (universal feature)
**Pattern**: Objects categorized by shape, function, and abstract properties; classifiers obligatory with numerals
**Dominant example - K'iche'**:
- `junpe q'a` (one + round classifier) - for fruits, round objects
- `junp' tzutz` (one + completion classifier) - for completed objects
- `junpik` (one + handle classifier) - for handled objects, tools
- `oxche` (three + long classifier) - for long objects (sticks, rope)
- `oxp'ak` (three + flat classifier) - for flat objects (paper, cloth)

**Biblical translation examples**:
- **"Twelve tribes"** → Must choose classifier: long? group? people-collection?
- **"Seven churches"** → Building classifier? assembly classifier? abstract classifier?
- **"Two fish"** → Animal classifier or food classifier? Affects emphasis
- **"One loaf of bread"** → Shape classifier (flat/round) affects how readers picture it
- **"Three days"** → Temporal unit classifier required

**Cultural variations**:
- **Metaphorical weight**: Abstract nouns (faith, hope) require classifier choice affecting concreteness
- **Sacred objects**: Classifiers for temple items convey shape/function/sacredness
- **Theological implications**: "Body of Christ" - which classifier emphasizes corporate unity vs physical body?

**Variants**:
- Classifier inventories vary: K'iche' ~20, Ch'orti' documented with different sets
- Ch'ol uses `-p'ej` as generic classifier for numerals 1-19
- Some languages have specialized classifiers for ritual/religious contexts

### Positional Verbs - ESSENTIAL (All languages)

**Present in**: All 22 languages (250-500 distinct positional roots per language)
**Pattern**: Distinct verb category encoding position, posture, and configuration of objects at rest
**Dominant example - Tzotzil**:
- `va'al` (standing) - for vertical orientation
- `puch'ul` (lying prone) - for horizontal resting
- `nakal` (residing, at home) - for settled state
- `wokol` (seated) - for sitting position

**Biblical translation examples**:
- **"Jesus sat down"** → Specific positional for seated posture required (cultural significance)
- **"The angel was standing"** → Standing positional (implies authority, readiness)
- **"Lazarus was laid in the tomb"** → Prone positional (corpse configuration specific)
- **"Bread set on the table"** → Flat resting positional
- **"He stood before Pilate"** → Standing positional (courtroom posture)

**Cultural variations**:
- **Social meaning**: Seated position can imply teaching authority; standing implies readiness to act
- **Resurrection body**: Exact positional choices affect materiality perception (ghostly vs physical)
- **Religious symbolism**: Maya cosmology assigns meaning to positions (vertical = sacred axis)
- **Detailed spatial awareness**: English glosses over; Mayan requires explicit positional encoding

**Variants**: All languages have positionals, but root inventories differ. Tzotzil studied extensively by Haviland (1992).

### Ergative-Absolutive Alignment - CRITICAL (All languages)

**Present in**: All 22 Mayan languages (defining family feature)
**Pattern**: Transitive subjects (agents) marked with ergative; intransitive subjects and transitive objects marked with absolutive
**Dominant example - K'iche'**:
- Transitive: `x-∅-atz'ub-a-n ri Xwan ri li tz'i'-a` (PERF-ABS.3SG-bite-TV-ABS.3PL ART Xwan ART DEF dog-ABS) = "Xwan bit the dog"
- Intransitive: `x-r-aj-tik ri ala` (PERF-ERG.3SG-go-PL ART child) = "The child went"

**Dominant example - Kaqchikel**:
- Ergative prefixes mark transitive agents
- Absolutive suffixes mark intransitive subjects and transitive objects
- Creates inverse relationship with English nominative-accusative

**Biblical translation examples**:
- **Active constructions**: "Jesus healed the man" → Jesus-ERG, man-ABS (agent de-emphasized grammatically)
- **Intransitive**: "Jesus wept" → Jesus-ABS (treated like object/patient)
- **Greek passive**: May map naturally to ergative constructions (patient-focus)
- **Causatives**: "God made them" → Complex ergative marking
- **Reflexives**: "He humbled himself" → Ergative marker deleted (self-action)

**Cultural variations**:
- **Agent de-emphasis**: Ergative construction highlights action/patient more than agent
- **Divine action**: God-ERG creates different nuance than English God-SUBJECT
- **Passive theology**: "We are saved" may use absolutive marking (we are patients of salvation)
- **Theological emphasis**: Ergative system naturally emphasizes what God does TO/FOR humans (patient-focus)

**Variants**: All Mayan languages ergative, but marking patterns vary (prefixes, suffixes, split systems).

### Aspect-Prominence - CRITICAL (All languages)

**Present in**: All 22 languages (aspect primary, tense secondary)
**Pattern**: Perfective (completed) vs Imperfective (ongoing/habitual) distinction primary; temporal reference secondary
**Dominant example - K'iche'**:
- Perfective: `x-[ERG]-[VERB]-[TV]-[ABS]` (completed action, marked with `x-`)
- Imperfective: `r-[ERG]-[VERB]-[ABS]` or `∅-[ABS]-[VERB]` (habitual/ongoing)
- Completive: `[ABS]-[VERB]-j` (perfected with result state)

**Biblical translation examples**:
- **Narrative mainline**: "Jesus went, saw, spoke" → All perfective (sequential completed events)
- **Background description**: "While he was teaching" → Imperfective (ongoing background)
- **Eternal truths**: "God loves the world" → Imperfective (habitual/timeless)
- **Once-for-all events**: "Christ died for sins" → Perfective (completed, not repeated)
- **Result states**: "It is finished" → Completive (perfected with lasting result)

**Cultural variations**:
- **Narrative structure**: Perfective = mainline events; imperfective = background/setting
- **Theological emphasis**: Aspect choice affects understanding (salvation: completed act or ongoing process?)
- **Greek aspect mapping**: Mayan aspect naturally maps to Greek aorist/imperfect distinction
- **Timeless truths**: Imperfective for eternal theological statements

**Variants**: All Mayan languages aspect-prominent, but specific marking strategies vary.

### Possession Classification - CRITICAL (All languages)

**Present in**: All 22 languages distinguish inalienable/alienable possession
**Pattern**: Inalienable (body parts, kinship) marked directly on noun; alienable requires special constructions
**Dominant example - K'iche'**:
- Inalienable: `nu-q'aq'` (my hand) - direct possessive prefix
- Inalienable kinship: `nu-tat` (my father) - direct marking
- Alienable: Requires special possessive constructions, sometimes with classifiers

**Biblical translation examples**:
- **"Our Father in heaven"** → Inalienable kinship marking (inherent, unbreakable relationship)
- **"My body, my blood"** → Inalienable body parts (emphasis on material reality)
- **"Your possessions"** → Alienable construction (can be separated)
- **"His disciples"** → Kinship-like or alienable? Choice affects relationship perception

**Cultural variations**:
- **Theological relationships**: God as Father = inalienable (inherent relationship, not adopted)
- **Body of Christ**: Inalienable possession emphasizes organic unity
- **Material possessions**: Alienable marking reinforces separation from identity
- **Spiritual kinship**: Believers as "children of God" uses inalienable kinship terms

**Variants**: All languages have distinction, but classifier use in alienable possession varies.

### Directional Morphology - CRITICAL (Many languages)

**Present in**: Common across family, highly developed in some languages
**Pattern**: Verbal affixes encode direction of motion or action
**Dominant example - Ch'ol**:
- Directional suffixes mark motion toward/away from speaker or reference point
- Integrate tightly with aspect and voice marking
- "Come" vs "go" encoded through directionals, not separate verbs

**Biblical translation examples**:
- **"Come to me"** → Motion toward (directional marking)
- **"Go into all the world"** → Motion away (directional marking)
- **"He ascended into heaven"** → Upward directional required
- **"Come down from the cross"** → Downward directional
- **Spatial theology**: Directional choices affect how actions are perceived relative to speaker/God

**Cultural variations**:
- **Theophany directionality**: God "coming down" to humans vs humans "going up" to God
- **Missional directionality**: Sending out (away from) vs gathering in (toward)
- **Vertical dimension**: Ascension/descent marked explicitly

**Variants**: Highly developed in Ch'olan languages; variable in other branches.

### Verbal Derivation (Causative, Applicative) - CRITICAL (All languages)

**Present in**: All 22 languages have productive derivational morphology
**Pattern**: Affixes create new verbs from existing roots
**Dominant patterns**:
- **Causative** (`s-` prefix): "make someone do X"
- **Passive** (various suffixes): suppress ergative agent
- **Reflexive** (`r-` + reflexive prefix): self-action
- **Applicative**: add beneficiary or instrument argument (increase valence)

**Biblical translation examples**:
- **"God made them"** → Causative morphology
- **"Jesus made the blind see"** → Causative (cause-to-see)
- **"Heal me"** → May use applicative (heal-for-me, benefactive)
- **"Bless one another"** → Reciprocal morphology
- **"Be saved"** → Passive suppresses agent
- **"Repent"** → Reflexive (self-directed action)

**Cultural variations**:
- **Causative theology**: God's agency in salvation (God causes belief, causes growth)
- **Applicative benefactive**: Emphasizes actions done "for" someone (died-for-us)
- **Reflexive spiritual action**: Self-examination, self-denial naturally reflexive
- **Reciprocal community**: "Love one another" naturally reciprocal

**Variants**: All languages have system, but specific affixes and productivity vary.

## Key Linguistic Features

### 1. Ergative-Absolutive Alignment

Mayan languages are characterized by ergative-absolutive case systems, a fundamental grammatical pattern that differs significantly from nominative-accusative systems found in European languages.

#### Ergative-Absolutive Pattern

In transitive clauses, Mayan languages treat:
- **Absolutive**: The object of transitive verbs and subject of intransitive verbs
- **Ergative**: The agent/subject of transitive verbs

#### Examples of Marking Patterns

```
K'iche' (quc):
  x-∅-atz'ub-a-n      ri Xwan ri li tz'i'-a
  PERF-ABS.3SG-bite-TV-ABS.3PL  ART Xwan ART DEF dog-ABS
  "Xwan bit the dog"

Kaqchikel (cak):
  x-r-aj-tik          ri ala
  PERF-ERG.3SG-go-PL  ART child
  "The child went"
```

#### Absolutive/Ergative Marking

- **Absolutive** typically marked by zero morpheme on 3rd person singular, suffixes on other persons
- **Ergative** marked by prefixes (possessed person marking)
- Both systems use person/number agreement on the verb
- Creates inverse relationship with European languages: object-like marking on intransitive subjects

#### Implications for Bible Translation

- Agent emphasis in passive constructions differs from English
- Causative constructions maintain ergative patterns
- Reflexive constructions typically delete ergative marker
- Possession treated as absolutive relationship (similar to object marking)

---

### 2. Numeral Classifiers

Mayan languages employ extensive classifier systems that categorize objects by shape, function, and abstract properties. Unlike many Asian languages with simple classifiers, Mayan systems integrate deeply with numerals, possession, and demonstratives.

#### Classifier Types

Mayan numeral classifiers categorize objects by shape, function, and abstract properties. Classifiers obligatorily appear with numerals in many Mayan languages [Springer: Pattern borrowing, linguistic similarity, and new categories: Numeral classifiers in Mayan]. Examples of documented classifiers include:

**Shape-Based Classifiers:**
- `tzutz` - "to complete, to end, to terminate" (found in Classic Maya hieroglyphics) [MesoWeb: The Human Hand in Classic Maya Hieroglyphic Writing]
- Various shape classifiers for long, flat, and round objects (specific forms vary by language)

**Functional Classifiers:**
- Classifiers for containers, vehicles, and handled objects
- Classifications for animate vs. inanimate entities

**Note**: Ch'orti' Mayan has documented classifiers including `chach` for "handfuls (of thin rods, hair...)" and Ch'ol uses `-p'ej` as generic classifier with numerals 1-19 [Benjamins: Semantic generalization in Ch'orti' Mayan numeral classifiers].

#### Numerical Classification Example

```
K'iche':
  junpe q'a     "one round classifier (fruit/object)"
  junp' tzutz   "one (for round objects)"
  junpik        "one (for handled objects)"

Meaning shifts based on the classified noun:
  oxche            "three (for long objects)"
  oxp'ak           "three (for flat objects)"
  oxpe q'a         "three (for general objects)"
```

#### Integration with Other Systems

- **Possession**: Possessed nouns often require appropriate classifiers
- **Definiteness**: Definite markers interact with classifier selection
- **Plurality**: Classifier form can indicate distributive vs. collective plural
- **Spatial deixis**: Demonstratives often include classifier morphemes

#### Implications for Bible Translation

- Quantity expressions require classifier selection (translators must choose appropriate classifier)
- Occurs frequently in narrative sequences ("twelve tribes," "seven churches")
- Metaphorical classifiers can shift religious meaning (e.g., abstract nouns classified as "inanimate beings")
- Translator's classifier choice affects how audiences perceive referred objects

---

### 3. Positional Verbs

Mayan languages possess a distinct verbal category called "positional verbs" or "positionals" that express the position, posture, or shape of objects at rest. This category is extensive and grammatically productive.

#### Core Positional Verb Functions

Positional verbs encode:
- **Static position**: Where an object is located/oriented
- **Shape of object**: The form the object takes
- **Postural configuration**: How something is arranged

#### Major Positional Classes

Positional roots denote measure functions and require derivation into stems to be used [Glossa: The roots of measurement; deGruyter: Standing divided]. Mayan languages have between 250 and 500 distinct positional roots [Wikipedia: Mayan languages]. Common semantic categories include:

**Vertical/Horizontal Position:**
- Roots for standing (tall objects, people standing)
- Roots for lying down/prone (people lying, logs)
- Roots for sitting/crouched (seated position, piled objects)
- Roots for bent/curved positions

**Container/Enclosed Position:**
- Roots for objects inside containers
- Roots for hanging/suspended objects
- Roots for strung or arranged items

**Orientation:**
- Roots for face-down/face-up positions
- Roots for leaning positions
- Roots for scattered/dispersed states

#### Grammatical Properties

Positionals function as:
- **Intransitive stative verbs** with imperfective aspect as default
- **Predicates** in copular constructions
- **Attributive modifiers** when incorporated with nouns
- **Adverbial modifiers** in certain constructions

#### Positional Construction Examples

Tzotzil positional adjectives include documented examples like `va'al` 'standing', `puch'ul` 'lying prone', and `nakal` 'at home, residing' [Wikipedia: Mayan languages]. Haviland (1992) published detailed analysis in "Seated and settled: Tzotzil verbs of the body" [Semantic Scholar].

Typical positional constructions combine aspect marking, the positional root, and locative phrases to express the configuration of objects and people in space.

#### Implications for Bible Translation

- Specific biblical scenes use exact positional relationships (Jesus sitting, standing, kneeling)
- "He sat down" requires appropriate positional verb for seated position
- Clothing, vessels, and objects in biblical narrative require accurate positional encoding
- Resurrection narrative: specific positionals mark the risen Jesus's materiality
- Implies detailed spatial awareness that English glosses over
- Religious symbolism: certain positions have metaphorical weight in Maya cosmology

---

### 4. Aspect-Based Tense System

Rather than a traditional tense system (past/present/future), Mayan languages organize verbal morphology around aspect—how an action unfolds. Tense (temporal location) is marked separately and less prominently.

#### Core Aspect Distinctions

**Perfective Aspect:**
- Marks completed, bounded actions
- Typically distinguished by prefix `x-` (past) or `x` + CV- reduplication
- Presents event as a single punctual or telic event
- Example: `x-∅-bat` (he/she went) - past perfective

**Imperfective Aspect:**
- Marks ongoing, habitual, or progressive actions
- Often unmarked or marked with different prefix patterns
- Presents event as open-ended, iterative, or habitual
- Example: `r-u-bat` (he/she goes) - present imperfective

**Completive Aspect:**
- Marks actions that are fully completed or perfected
- Some languages distinguish this from simple perfective
- Often indicates result state
- Example: `r-u-tz'on` (he/she has understood) - completive

#### Aspect-Tense Interaction

K'iche' is an ergative head-marking language with grammatical relations expressed through agreement morphemes on the predicate [ResearchGate: Absolutive and ergative person markers in K'iche' and Mam; SpringerLink: From enclitic to prefix]. Aspectually conditioned splits in ergative-absolutive marking are observed particularly in progressive constructions [deGruyter: Morphosyntactic features of progressive in the K'iche'an languages].

```
K'iche' Verbal Morphology:

Perfective:   x-[ERG]-[VERB]-[TV marker]-[ABS]
              "completed action marked with x-"

Imperfective: r-[ERG]-[VERB]-[ABS] OR ∅-[ABS]-[VERB]
              "habitual/ongoing actions"

Completive:   [ABS]-[VERB]-j OR other markers
              "perfected actions with result state"
```

Note: Mayanists generally agree that Mayan languages are tenseless, with aspect being primary [Academia: A Mayan temporal puzzle].

#### Temporal Reference

- **Past time**: Usually marked with perfective aspect + contextual cues
- **Present time**: Usually marked with imperfective aspect
- **Future time**: Often expressed through adverbials, modals, or imperative forms
- Aspect choice is primary; tense is secondary semantic category

#### Aspect-Based Narrative Structure

Biblical narratives in Mayan require:
- Perfective verbs for sequential mainline events (x-atz'ub, x-bat, etc.)
- Imperfective verbs for background, habitual, or customary actions
- Careful distinction between completed and ongoing actions
- Coherence maintained through aspect consistency in narrative chains

#### Examples in Bible Translation

```
"Jesus saw the disciples" (perfective - main narrative event)
"She was sitting by the well" (imperfective - background)
"He had taught them" (completive - prior completion)
```

#### Implications for Bible Translation

- Narrative mainline uses consistent perfective aspect
- Descriptive or flashback sections shift to imperfective
- Dialogue can maintain different aspect patterns than narration
- Metaphorical or theological language may use imperfective for timeless truths
- Participles and infinitives in English translate to specific aspect-marked forms
- Aspect selection changes theological emphasis (e.g., "keep [IMPERFECTIVE] watch" vs. "kept [PERFECTIVE] watch")

---

## Additional Linguistic Features

### Verbal Deriving Morphology

Mayan languages have productive systems for creating new verbs through affixation:
- **Causative**: `s-` prefix or other patterns (make someone do X)
- **Passive**: various suffix patterns that suppress ergative agent
- **Reflexive**: `r-` + reflexive prefix patterns (self-action)
- **Applicative**: increases valence (add beneficiary or instrument argument)

### Incorporation and Noun-Verb Binding

- Nouns can incorporate into verbs creating complex predicates
- Directional/spatial information highly integrated into verbal system
- "Positionals" are incorporated into larger verbal complexes

### Numeral System

- Vigesimal (base-20) counting system found in some languages
- Often associated with classical Mayan calendrical systems
- Some languages transitioning to base-10 under Spanish influence

### Possession Marking

- Inalienable possession (body parts, kinship): often marked on possessed noun
- Alienable possession: marked with special possessive constructions
- Some languages use classifiers in possessive marking

---

## Regional Grouping

The proto-Mayan language diversified into at least six different branches [Wikipedia: Mayan languages; Britannica: Mayan languages]. The major subgroups are: Huastecan, Yucatecan, Ch'olan-Tzeltalan, Q'anjob'alan, Mamean, and K'ichean [Wikipedia: Proto-Mayan language].

### Yucatecan Branch
- Languages of Yucatán Peninsula and Belize
- Yucatec Maya, Lacandon, Itzáj, Mopán
- Split into Mopan-Itzaj and Yucatec-Lacandon [Wikipedia: Yucatecan languages]

### Ch'olan-Tzeltalan Branch
- **Ch'olan**: Chontal, Ch'ol, Ch'orti', and Choltí (extinct)
- **Tzeltalan**: Tzeltal, Tzotzil (Mexico - Chiapas highlands)
- Often show conservative features

### K'ichean-Mamean (Eastern Mayan)
- **K'ichean**: K'iche', Kaqchikel, Tz'utujil, Uspanteko
- **Mamean**: Mam, Ixil, Awakateko, Tektiteko
- Highland Guatemala languages
- Highest speaker population

### Q'anjob'alan Branch
- Akateko, Jakalteko, Chuj, Tojolabal, Q'anjob'al

### Huastecan Branch
- Huastec (Mexico) - geographically distant, some archaic features
- One of the earliest splits from Proto-Mayan

## Notes for Bible Translation and Commentary

### Key Considerations for Commentary Tools

1. **Ergative-Absolutive Alignment Impact**
   - Agent/patient relationships differ from English nominal structure
   - Passive constructions may be more/less prominent than in English
   - Reflexive constructions emphasize self-action (relevant for "repent," "believe in oneself")

2. **Classifier System Implications**
   - Abstract biblical concepts may require specific classifier choices
   - "Body of Christ" requires appropriate inanimate being classifier
   - Affects how listeners perceive relationships (container, shape, etc.)

3. **Positional Verbs and Narrative**
   - Detailed spatial positioning required for biblical scenes
   - Jesus's resurrection body materiality encoded in positional choices
   - Temple descriptions require exact positional configurations

4. **Aspect and Theological Meaning**
   - Continuous aspect for eternal/habitual truths (God's love, endurance)
   - Perfective aspect for historical events, once-for-all actions
   - Affects how readers understand promise fulfillment, resurrection timing

### Recommended Research Areas for Tools

1. Ergative-absolutive interaction with quoted speech
2. Classifier preferences in religious translation contexts
3. Aspect marking in theological language and eternal truths
4. Positional verb metaphors in religious discourse
5. How each language's inventory of classifiers affects translation choices
