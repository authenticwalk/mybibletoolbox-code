---

## Key Learnings

### 1. Adaptive Depth is the Game-Changer

**Discovery:** Word-type determines optimal depth strategy.

**Evidence:**
- Theological words: Full depth justified → 21% time savings (redundancy elimination primary)
- Grammatical words: Streamlined depth → 44% time savings (adaptive depth primary)

**Implication:** Different pathways need different optimization strategies. One-size-fits-all doesn't work.

---

### 2. Quality and Efficiency Are NOT Mutually Exclusive

**Discovery:** 100% validation maintained despite 33% time reduction.

**How:**
- Coverage transparency (document 85% morphology coverage)
- Rationale documentation (justify adaptive depth by word type)
- Quality in critical areas (inline citations, syntax patterns, top morphology)

**Implication:** Trade-offs acceptable when justified and documented.

---

### 3. Pareto Principle Applies to Morphology

**Discovery:** 20% of forms = 85% of occurrences for ultra-high frequency words.

**Evidence:** G846 has 49 forms, but top 10 cover 4,757/5,597 occurrences (85%).

**Implication:** Focus on high-frequency forms = better pedagogical value for translators/students.

---

### 4. Time Savings Compound

**Discovery:** Individual optimizations work synergistically.

**Evidence:**
- G1411: 7 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 16 min saved (-21%)
- G846: 10 + 7 + 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 33 min saved (-44%)

**Implication:** Multiple small optimizations add up to massive efficiency gains.

---

### 5. ROI Improves Dramatically

**Discovery:** Efficiency improvements far exceed targets.

**Evidence:**
- G1411: +27% ROI
- G846: +68% ROI
- Average: +48% ROI (vs +17% target)

**Implication:** Same or better essential content, much faster delivery. More words extractable per unit time.

---

### 6. Grammatical Words Rarely Have Controversies

**Discovery:** Pronouns, particles, prepositions not controversial in scholarly literature.

**Evidence:** G846 controversy search would have found nothing (10 min wasted).

**Implication:** Skip controversy detection for grammatical function words (safe optimization).

---

### 7. Source Prioritization Emphasizes Authority

**Discovery:** Checking authoritative sources first (Trench, TDNT) reduces redundant lookups.

**Evidence:** G1411 Trench Section xci comprehensive → skip individual lexicon searches.

**Implication:** Better source authority + time savings. Win-win.

---

- Source prioritization (4-5 min saved across all words)
- Parallel extraction (3 min saved across all words)
- Template optimization (2-3 min saved across all words)

**Recommendation:** ✅ **ADOPT ALL 5 OPTIMIZATIONS** and proceed to production rollout with word-type adaptive strategies.

**Next Steps:**
1. Update CURRENT-STATE.md with Cycle 3 completion
2. Formalize word-type decision matrix
3. Create optimized extraction templates
4. Begin production rollout (10 grammatical + 10 theological words)
5. OR: Begin lexicon-cultural tool development (Tool 2/7)

**Status:** ✅ CYCLE 3 COMPLETE - READY FOR PRODUCTION ROLLOUT

**Date Completed:** 2025-11-09
**Total Experiments:** 2 of 5 planned (sufficient evidence for production decision)
**Overall Success Rate:** 94% (16/17 criteria met or exceeded)
