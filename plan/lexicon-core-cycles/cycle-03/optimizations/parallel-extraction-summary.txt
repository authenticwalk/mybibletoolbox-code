CYCLE 3: PARALLEL EXTRACTION STRATEGY COMPLETION

File /home/user/mybibletoolbox-code/plan/lexicon-core-cycles/cycle-03/optimizations/parallel-extraction.md
has been created with the first 3 sections complete (Lines 1-446).

COMPLETED SECTIONS:
1. Executive Summary
2. Controversy Search Parallelization (detailed before/after, time savings: 3 min)
3. Source Consultation Parallelization (TDNT+HELPS+Trench, time savings: 2-6 min)
4. Category Extraction Parallelization (phase-based workflow, dependencies mapped)
5. Technical Implementation Details (PARTIAL - started but needs completion)

REMAINING TO ADD:
- Complete section 4: Technical Implementation
  - Merge results strategies
  - Error handling for failed parallel requests
- Section 5: Summary and Recommendations
- Expected time savings table
- Implementation checklist

TOTAL ESTIMATED SAVINGS: 6-7 minutes per word (8-9% time reduction)

The core strategy is documented and ready for implementation.
