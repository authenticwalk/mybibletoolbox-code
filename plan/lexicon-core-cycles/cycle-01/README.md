# Lexicon-Core Tool: Cycle 1 - Initial Implementation

**Cycle:** 1 of 7+
**Started:** 2025-11-08
**Status:** In Progress

## Purpose

Run 5 diverse experiments to establish baseline methodology and identify what works/fails.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: G846 αὐτός (High-Frequency)
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Occurrences:** 5,597
- **Goal:** Test comprehensive extraction on ultra-high-frequency word
- **Output:** `/plan/strongs-enrichment-tools/01-lexicon-core/experiments/exp1-high-freq-word/`

### Experiment 2: G1411 δύναμις (Medium-Frequency Theological)
- **Status:** Pending
- **Occurrences:** 120
- **Goal:** Test controversy detection (dunamis ≠ dynamite)

### Experiment 3: Rare Word
- **Status:** Pending
- **Occurrences:** <10
- **Goal:** Test limited data handling, honest limitations

### Experiment 4: H430 Elohim (Hebrew)
- **Status:** Pending
- **Occurrences:** 2,606
- **Goal:** Test BDB extraction, Hebrew-specific features

### Experiment 5: Love Word Family
- **Status:** Pending
- **Words:** G25, G26, G5368
- **Goal:** Test convergence detection across related words

## Success Criteria for Cycle 1

- [ ] All 5 experiments produce valid YAML output
- [ ] Learnings document captures failure patterns
- [ ] Validation scores documented for each experiment
- [ ] Identified specific improvements for Cycle 2

## Learnings

Will document as experiments progress...
