## Notable Findings

### 1. Extremely Rare in Classical Greek
Only 3 doubtful instances in all of classical literature; Christians took marginal term and filled it with theological content.

### 2. Massive Frequency Increase
Classical: 3 → LXX: 14 → NT: 116 = 39x increase from LXX to NT

### 3. Five Major Controversies
Especially rich in scholarly debates:
- John 21:15-17 interpretation
- Unconditional love fallacy
- Nygren's exclusivist thesis
- Translation issues
- Eschatological tensions

### 4. Love Feasts Historical Practice
Concrete, embodied practice with detailed historical documentation (Pliny, Ignatius, Cyprian).

### 5. Deliberate Linguistic Choice
NT writers avoided available ἔρως terminology; chose marginal ἀγάπη to avoid pagan connotations and create new semantic space.
