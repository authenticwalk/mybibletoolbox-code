## Recommendations

**For Future Particle Extractions:**
- ✅ Continue particle-specific approach (usage patterns vs. morphology)
- ✅ Maintain high emphasis on theological/rhetorical significance
- ✅ Document genre-specific variations thoroughly
- ✅ Include scholarly debates where relevant (e.g., primary force confirmatory vs. inferential)

**For Production Rollout:**
- ✅ This extraction exemplifies high-quality Cycle 4 particle methodology
- ✅ Can serve as template for other inferential particles (ἄρα, διό, etc.)
- ✅ Theological significance section approach applicable to other connectives
