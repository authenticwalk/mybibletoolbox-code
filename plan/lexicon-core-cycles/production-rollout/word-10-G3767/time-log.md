## Analysis of Time Variance

**Why longer than G1161 δέ (48 min)?**

1. **More extensive theological significance section** (+5 min)
   - οὖν has crucial role in Pauline theology (doctrine → application)
   - Multiple major theological passages documented
   - Extensive diatribe-style usage analysis

2. **John's Gospel distinctive usage required deep analysis** (+3 min)
   - 200+ occurrences with weakened force
   - Scholarly debate on "oral residue" explanation
   - Comparison with Synoptics needed

3. **More complex functional categories** (+2 min)
   - 5 primary functions (vs. δέ's 4-5)
   - Interrogative function unique to οὖν
   - Exhortatory function theologically significant

4. **Extensive collocation patterns** (+2 min)
   - Τί οὖν questions documented extensively (15+ in Romans)
   - Multiple conditional/temporal combinations
   - μέν οὖν resumptive construction

**Mitigation strategies for future similar words:**
- Could streamline theological significance section slightly
- Collocation documentation could be more selective (top 5 instead of 6)
- John's Gospel analysis could be condensed to 2 paragraphs instead of 3

## Notes

- Particle-specific approach: documenting usage patterns instead of morphological forms
- Enhanced diachronic: 7 points including Homer → Classical → Koine → NT development
- Skip: Controversy detection, HELPS/TDNT (no particle entries)
- Focus: Functional categories, syntax patterns, theological/rhetorical significance
- Strong emphasis on Pauline argumentation and Johannine narrative style
- 100% inline citations maintained; zero fabrication
