## Detailed Component Analysis

### 1. Etymology (1.0/1.0 points) ✅ EXCELLENT

**Score:** 100%

**Strengths:**
- Complete etymological development: μήν → μέν (weakened form)
- Historical linguistic context: Attic alphabet evolution (4th c. BCE)
- Semantic development clearly traced: asseverative → correlative
- Diachronic explanation of functional shift
- Related forms documented (μήν with distinction)
- Semantic core defined: "forward-pointing anticipatory marker"

**Evidence:**
- Classification: "Primary particle (weakened form of μήν)" #{blb-strongs}
- Historical origin: "Originally an asseverative, emphatic particle" #{perseus-smyth}
- Semantic development: "Evolved from standalone emphatic marker to primarily correlative function" #{perseus-smyth}
- Attic detail: "In Attic Greek before 4th c. BCE, μήν written as μέν since eta not yet in Attic alphabet" #{wiktionary}

**Completeness:** Full etymological documentation with diachronic development

---

### 2. Usage Patterns (1.425/1.5 points) ✅ EXCELLENT

**Score:** 95% (slight deduction for theoretical nature of ~95% coverage claim)

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive positional patterns (2nd-6th position with references)
- Detailed correlative construction documentation (μέν...δέ)
- Particle combinations thoroughly documented (μὲν οὖν, μὲν δή)
- μέν solitarium well-explained with frequency data
- Placement rules clearly articulated (article+noun, prepositional phrases, contrasted words)
- High-frequency collocations documented (4 major patterns)
- Coverage explicitly stated: ~95% syntactic contexts

**Evidence:**
- Postpositive positioning: 2nd (most common) through 6th (rare) with NT references
- μέν...δέ: structure, meaning, function, word order, contrast strength, ellipsis, multiple contrasts, concessive force
- μὲν οὖν: 27 instances in Acts vs. 1 in Luke #{cambridge-clark}
- μέν solitarium: 15 instances in Acts vs. 1 in Luke #{cambridge-clark}
- Collocations: ὁ μέν...ὁ δέ, οἱ μὲν...οἱ δέ, ὃς μὲν...ὃς δέ, τοῦτο μὲν...τοῦτο δέ

**Minor Gap:**
- Coverage percentage (~95%) is reasonable estimate but not empirically verified from corpus analysis
- Could include more specific NT verse examples for each pattern

**Overall:** Excellent usage pattern documentation exceeding morphology replacement requirement

1. **Correlative/Anticipatory:** Dominant function, forward-pointing, never connective
2. **Affirmative/Emphatic:** Historical development, Koine status debated, diachronic confusion addressed
3. **Concessive:** Logically subordinate, 'while/though' relationships
4. **Distinctive/Contrastive:** Weaker than ἀλλά, gentle distinction

**Discourse grammar perspective:**
- Forward-pointing nature
- Lack of semantic content
- Pragmatic role
- Theoretical frameworks (Wakker, H. Dik, Fresch)
