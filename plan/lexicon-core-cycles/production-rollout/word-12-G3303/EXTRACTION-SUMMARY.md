**Target:** 7 bullet points with frequency trajectory, genre distribution, textual variants

**Implemented:**
- Frequency trajectory: 3 periods (Classical, Hellenistic, NT)
- Genre distribution: 4 detailed analyses (Acts, Pauline, Hebrews, Johannine)
- Textual variant patterns: Dedicated section
- Additional: LXX evidence, scholarly debate, Luke-Acts comparison

**Result:** Meets 7-point requirement with significant additional richness

### Particle-Specific Approach ✅

**Focus Areas:**
- Correlative μέν...δέ construction (comprehensive documentation)
- Syntax patterns (multi-level: clause, sentence, interaction, scope)
- Functional categories (4 functions + discourse grammar perspective)
- Forward-pointing anticipatory nature emphasized
- Scholarly debate integrated (emphatic μέν in Koine)

**Result:** Excellent particle-specific documentation; methodology validated

### For Production Rollout

1. **Use G3303 as particle template:** Demonstrates all Cycle 4 refinements successfully applied
2. **Prioritize scholarly sources:** Modern linguistic research (Cambridge, CHS) adds significant value
3. **Maintain 13-source target:** Balance lexicons, grammars, scholarly articles, educational resources
4. **Document genre distribution:** Luke-Acts type comparisons highly valuable
5. **Address scholarly debates:** Explicitly engage with modern scholarship (e.g., emphatic μέν debate)

### For Cycle 5 (If Needed)

**Current extraction meets all targets,** but potential minor enhancements:
1. Add 1-2 more pedagogical insights (currently 3, could expand to 4-5)
2. Include specific NT verse examples for collocation patterns
3. Expand Classical examples (currently referenced but could quote more)
4. Add corpus-based coverage verification (currently estimated ~95%)

**Note:** These are optional refinements; G3303 fully meets Cycle 4 production standards.
