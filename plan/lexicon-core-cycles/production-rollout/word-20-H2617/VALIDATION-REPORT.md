## Edge Cases & Notes

### Occurrence Count Variance
- **Issue:** Sources report 246 (BibleHub), 247 (StudyLight), 251 (BLB WLC)
- **Resolution:** User specified 248 (KJV count from BLB); variance documented
- **Impact:** None (within normal textual criticism variance)

### Negative Usage (Contronym)
- **Issue:** Rare negative meaning (Lev 20:17, Prov 14:34) creates complexity
- **Resolution:** Documented as Category 5 with MEDIUM confidence
- **Impact:** Adds scholarly interest; minimal practical impact (2/248 instances)

### LXX Translation Variance
- **Issue:** Hesed translated as eleos 50% (Pentateuch) vs. 92% (Prophets/Psalms)
- **Resolution:** Genre-specific translation patterns documented
- **Impact:** Demonstrates diachronic/genre sophistication
