## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Exceptionally Well:
1. **Parallel controversy searches** - Found 5 major debates quickly
2. **BDB/TWOT prioritization** - Authoritative Hebrew sources set strong foundation
3. **Hesed's richness** - Word itself is so theologically loaded that data was abundant
4. **Scholarly debate focus** - Glueck vs Sakenfeld controversy adds significant depth

### Challenges Encountered:
1. **Occurrence count variance** - Sources report 246-251; settled on user's 248
2. **Contronym debate** - Negative usage (Lev 20:17, Prov 14:34) adds complexity
3. **Translation terminology** - Multiple English renderings required careful documentation

### Future Optimizations:
1. Consider adding Dead Sea Scrolls usage data for Hebrew words (if available)
2. Explore Mishnaic/Talmudic development for key terms (post-biblical trajectory)
3. Add more ANE cognate analysis (Ugaritic, Akkadian parallels)
