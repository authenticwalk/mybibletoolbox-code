# ETYMOLOGY
# =============================================================================

etymology:
  root_derivation:
    primary_source: "Derived from G264 ἁμαρτάνω (hamartanō) {blb-G266}"
    core_meaning: "The root meaning involves 'a failing to hit the mark' {blb-G266}"
    verb_relationship: "From ἁμαρτάνειν (hamartanein), meaning 'to miss the mark' or 'to err' {biblehub-G266}"

  classical_etymology:
    literal_origin: "Originally 'to miss the mark' in archery contexts {lsj-hamartia}"
    homeric_usage: "Homer used hamartanō in Iliad 5.287 to speak of a man who failed to hit his opponent with a spear {open-our-eyes}"
    semantic_expansion: "By Classical period, used figuratively for all kinds of failures - to make a mistake, miss an opportunity, or fail to reach a goal {open-our-eyes}"
    lsj_definition: "More generally meant 'to do wrong, err or sin' according to Liddell, Scott and Jones {open-our-eyes}"

  scholarly_debate_etymology:
    archaic_meaning: "The matching verb hamartanō technically had the original meaning 'to miss the mark' in archery {equip-saints}"
    actual_nt_usage: "Hamartia seldom has that literal meaning, and you won't find any place in the New Testament where it is used to describe physical combat {equip-saints}"
    obsolescence_claim: "Such archery meaning would have been long obsolete by the time of the New Testament, and thus irrelevant {open-our-eyes}"
    classical_writers: "From Aeschylus and Thucydides down, the word had two primary meanings: (1) an error of the understanding, (2) a bad action, evil deed {blb-G266}"
    temporal_context: "By the time they were writing the New Testament, the average reader would not have heard the word as 'miss the mark,' unless thinking about Homer's Iliad, written 800 years earlier {open-our-eyes}"

  theological_etymology:
    significance: "As a military shooting term, means 'to fail to achieve a bull's-eye,' and in moral and ethical terms means 'to fail of one's purpose,' 'to go wrong,' 'to fail to reach a standard or ideal' {jesuswalk-lawlessness}"
    expansion: "Hamartia was used in early Greek for mistake, but in New Testament times, its use was broadened to include any wrongdoing {open-our-eyes}"

      position: "Sin is apocalyptic power, sometimes even personified, rather than intrinsic nature {mdpi-augustine}"
      pauline_theology: "For Paul, sin was not hereditary from generation to generation but a cosmic enslaving force {mdpi-augustine}"
      agency: "Sin has real agency - it 'reigns,' 'dwells,' 'deceives,' 'kills' (Romans 7:11)"
      imperial_language: "Sin as imperial personage that dominates and enslaves {biblehub-G266}"

    theological_implications:
      anthropology: "Affects understanding of human moral agency and responsibility"
      soteriology: "Shapes view of what Christ's work accomplishes - personal forgiveness vs. cosmic liberation"
      sanctification: "Influences progressive sanctification theology"

  4_sin_as_state_vs_acts:
    category: "Systematic Theology"
    debate: "Whether hamartia primarily refers to sin as state/condition or sinful acts"

    state_emphasis:
      position: "Hamartia often represents sin as moral condition or power, not merely individual acts"
      singular_usage: "Paul almost always uses hamartia in singular - sin as principle {wesleyan-rom5-8}"
      ontological: "Sin as ontological reality affecting human nature"
      augustinian_tradition: "Original sin as inherited condition, not just imitated actions"

    acts_emphasis:
      position: "Hamartia can refer to specific sinful deeds and violations"
      plural_usage: "When plural (hamartiai), clearly refers to individual sinful acts"
      volitional: "Emphasis on human responsibility for specific choices and actions"

    integrated_view:
      both_and: "Hamartia encompasses both state and acts - not either/or"
      semantic_range: "Different NT contexts emphasize different aspects"
      theological_balance: "Need both for full hamartiology - inherited condition AND personal responsibility"

  5_johannine_sinlessness:
    category: "Believers and Sin"
    text_focus: "1 John 1:8-10; 3:6, 9"
    debate: "Apparent contradiction - believers DO sin (1:8) vs. believers CANNOT sin (3:9)"

    habitual_sin_view:
      position: "Most popular evangelical view {sinless-christians}"
      interpretation: "While Christians sin occasionally (1 John 1:8-9), true Christians cannot sin habitually {gospel-coalition-sin}"
      present_tense: "1 John 3:6, 9 uses present tense - 'continues in sin' vs. occasional sin"
      practice_distinction: "Difference between practicing sin as lifestyle vs. occasional failures"

    sinless_perfection_view:
      position: "Some interpret 1 John 3:9 as claiming believers achieve sinless perfection"
      new_nature: "Born of God = new nature that cannot sin"
      wesleyan_tradition: "Entire sanctification traditions"

    two_natures_view:
      position: "Believer has two natures - old nature sins, new nature doesn't"
      internal_division: "Conflict between flesh and spirit (cf. Romans 7)"

    forensic_view:
      position: "Sin not imputed/counted to believer positionally in Christ"
      justification_focus: "Though believers commit sins, they are not 'sinners' in forensic status"

    scholarly_tension:
      interpretive_challenge: "Multiple traditional interpretations exist, with many solutions either softening plain language or interjecting theological constructs foreign to epistle's context {sinless-christians}"
      ongoing_debate: "No full consensus on resolution of apparent tension"

  6_sin_offering_translation:
    category: "Translation and Theology"
    text_focus: "2 Corinthians 5:21, Hebrews 10:6-8"
    debate: "Whether peri hamartias should be translated 'for sin' or 'sin offering' (technical term)"

    abstract_translation:
      position: "Translate as 'for sin' or 'concerning sin' - abstract reference"
      argument: "Context doesn't always demand technical sacrificial term"
      example: "2 Corinthians 5:21: 'God made him who knew no sin to be sin for us'"

    technical_translation:
      position: "Translate as 'sin offering' - technical Levitical term"
      lxx_background: "Peri hamartias is established technical term in LXX for sin offering {lxx-semantic}"
      levitical_context: "Leviticus 5:6 and sacrificial texts use this phrase technically {lxx-semantic}"
      typological: "Christ as fulfillment of OT sin offering system"

    contextual_approach:
      determination: "Translation depends on context - sometimes technical, sometimes abstract"
      hebrews_clear: "Hebrews 10:6, 8 clearly uses technical sense given sacrificial context"
      pauline_ambiguity: "Paul's usage may intentionally evoke both meanings"

# PEDAGOGICAL INSIGHTS
# =============================================================================

pedagogical_insights:
  insight_count: 7

  1_centrality_to_gospel:
    observation: "Cannot understand gospel without understanding hamartia - sin is THE problem for which Christ is THE solution"
    application: "Essential for evangelism, apologetics, and discipleship - Romans 3:23 paired with Romans 6:23"
    challenge: "Modern culture minimizes sin - translators and teachers must communicate gravity without losing NT nuance"

  2_etymology_caution:
    observation: "While 'missing the mark' etymology is historically accurate, it was largely obsolete by NT period {equip-saints}"
    application: "Use etymology as background illustration, not primary definition - focus on NT contextual usage"
    challenge: "Avoid over-emphasizing archery metaphor that NT authors may not have intended"
    pedagogical_value: "Can helpfully communicate falling short of God's standard, but don't claim it's the 'literal meaning'"

  3_semantic_diversity:
    observation: "Hamartia encompasses act, state, power, condition, and violation - not monolithic {blb-G266}"
    application: "Teach students to identify which aspect is emphasized in specific NT contexts"
    challenge: "English 'sin' is equally diverse but students may default to one narrow understanding"
    examples: "Romans 5-7 (power) vs. James 1:15 (progressive act) vs. 1 John 3:4 (violation/lawlessness)"

  4_pauline_personification:
    observation: "Paul's personification of sin in Romans 5-7 is dramatic and sustained - not casual metaphor {wesleyan-rom5-8}"
    application: "Help students see sin as enslaving power, not merely collection of bad choices - liberation theology"
    challenge: "Modern individualism resists corporate/cosmic sin concepts - needs cultural translation"
    pastoral_impact: "Frees believers from guilt over inability to overcome sin by willpower alone - points to Spirit's power"

  5_johannine_tension:
    observation: "1 John presents both reality of ongoing sin (1:8-10) AND incompatibility with new birth (3:6, 9)"
    application: "Teach both truth claims without flattening tension - believers both struggle with sin AND are transformed"
    challenge: "Avoid both antinomianism ('sin doesn't matter') and perfectionism ('must achieve sinlessness')"
    balanced_approach: "Habitual sin view offers helpful middle ground - lifestyle vs. occasional failures {gospel-coalition-sin}"

  6_synonym_precision:
    observation: "NT uses multiple sin terms with distinct nuances: hamartia (missing standard), anomia (lawlessness), paraptoma (falling) {biblefood-7words}"
    application: "Equip students to identify which sin term is used and why - reveals author's emphasis"
    challenge: "English translations often flatten distinctions by using 'sin' for all terms"
    examples: "1 John 3:4 deliberately uses both hamartia and anomia to define sin as lawlessness {jesuswalk-lawlessness}"

  7_atonement_foundation:
    observation: "Hamartia terminology foundational to atonement theology - LXX peri hamartias connects to Levitical sin offering {lxx-semantic}"
    application: "Teach OT sacrificial system as background for understanding Christ as sin offering"
    challenge: "Modern readers unfamiliar with Levitical law need cultural bridge"
    key_texts: "John 1:29 (Lamb of God), Hebrews 9-10 (once-for-all sacrifice), 2 Cor 5:21 (made sin for us)"
