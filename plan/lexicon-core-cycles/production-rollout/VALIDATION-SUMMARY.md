## Edge Cases and Challenges

### Successfully Handled Edge Cases

1. **Ultra-High Frequency (G2532 καί: 9,153 occurrences)**
   - **Challenge:** High frequency can dilute richness through generic usage
   - **Solution:** Focus on discourse grammar, theological significance (Trinitarian formulas)
   - **Result:** 9.0/10 richness (highest particle score), justified +4 min time variance

2. **Untranslatable Abstracts (H2617 hesed)**
   - **Challenge:** No single English equivalent captures full meaning
   - **Solution:** Document translation frequencies (mercy 149x, kindness 40x, etc.), explain compound translations
   - **Result:** Translation impossibility becomes richness asset (generates extensive discussion)

3. **Contronym Words (H2617 hesed)**
   - **Challenge:** Word means both "kindness" and "disgrace" (2 instances)
   - **Solution:** Document Klein's etymological options, note minimal practical impact
   - **Result:** Controversy documented without overstating significance

4. **Sacred Name Pronunciation (H3068 יְהוָה)**
   - **Challenge:** Original pronunciation lost, multiple reconstructions
   - **Solution:** Document all positions (Yahweh, Jehovah, alternatives), assign confidence levels
   - **Result:** 6 controversies documented with scholarly consensus clearly stated

### Remaining Challenges (Pending Words)

1. **Article ὁ (G3588: 19,870 occurrences)**
   - **Challenge:** Most frequent NT word, potential richness dilution
   - **Expected:** May need special handling, target 8.0/10 (lower than typical grammatical)

2. **Missing Grammatical Words (5 prepositions/pronouns)**
   - **Challenge:** Complete category 1 for valid aggregate analysis
   - **Needed:** G5100, G1722, G1537, G4314, G3588

3. **Missing Sin Word (G0266 ἁμαρτία)**
   - **Challenge:** Core soteriological term, expected high controversy
   - **Needed:** Complete Greek theological category

   - Words 9, 10, 11, 12 (particles except G2532)
   - Words 14-18 (Greek theological except G0026)

#### For Future Production Scaling:

**If 20-word batch completes successfully:**
1. ✅ Proceed to 100-word production batch
2. ✅ Maintain quality standards (8.5/10 avg, 100% validation)
3. ✅ Apply learnings from edge cases
4. ✅ Continue parallel processing for efficiency

**Expected Full Corpus Metrics (14,000 words):**
