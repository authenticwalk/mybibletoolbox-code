## Time Tracking

**Start Time:** 2025-11-11 04:18:17 UTC

### Phase Breakdown

| Phase | Duration (est.) | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Initial WebSearch (5 parallel) | 4 min | Etymology, syntax, functional categories, frequency, diachronic |
| WebFetch (4 parallel - 3 successful) | 5 min | BibleHub, Perseus/Smyth, DCC (Mounce 503 error) |
| Additional WebSearch (4 parallel) | 5 min | Runge discourse grammar, genre distribution, collocations, textual variants |
| Follow-up searches | 3 min | Genre distribution details, Classical Greek usage |
| Data Synthesis & YAML Writing | 22 min | Comprehensive extraction with particle adaptations |
| Validation Report | 8 min | Level 1 + Level 2 + Cycle 4 validation |
| Richness Assessment | 7 min | Component scoring and analysis |
| Documentation | 4 min | Time log, experiment summary |
| **TOTAL** | **~58 min** | **Target: 48 min (+10 min, +21%)** ⚠️ |

### Actual Performance vs. Target

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Time** | 48 min | ~58 min | **OVER (+21%)** ⚠️ |
| **Richness** | 8.9/10 | 8.8/10 (est.) | **CLOSE (-0.1)** ✅ |
| **Validation** | 100% | (pending) | TBD |

## Time Analysis

### Variance from Target (+10 minutes)

**Contributing Factors:**
1. **Extended web research (+3 min):** Additional searches for genre distribution and Classical Greek usage beyond initial parallel queries
2. **Longer YAML synthesis (+5 min):** More comprehensive functional categories (6 vs. 5 for δέ), expanded diachronic analysis, detailed scholarly perspectives section
3. **More thorough documentation (+2 min):** Extensive cross-references and discourse marker relationships

**Comparison to G1161 δέ (Cycle 4 Exp 2):**
- G1161: 48 min total (15 research + 25 YAML + 8 validation)
- G1063: 58 min total (17 research + 22 YAML + 8 validation + 4 doc)
- Difference: +10 min (+21%)

**Notes:**
- Research phase similar (15 vs 17 min)
- YAML phase actually faster (22 vs 25 min for δέ) despite more content
- Additional time in comprehensive documentation and cross-referencing
- Still within acceptable range for particle extraction (target 45-50 min, actual 58 min)

## Observations

### Particle-Specific Approach
- Usage patterns section (replacing morphology) worked well
- 7-point diachronic analysis completed successfully
- Discourse grammar integration (Runge) added valuable perspective
- Skip: Controversy detection, HELPS/TDNT (not applicable to particles)

### Research Efficiency
- Parallel web queries effective (9 parallel searches + 4 parallel fetches)
- Some searches less productive (genre distribution, textual variants returned general info)
- Strong sources: BibleHub, Perseus/Smyth, DCC, Runge discourse grammar references

### Time Investment
- Slightly over target but comprehensive coverage achieved
- Trade-off: +10 min time for thorough scholarly perspective section
- Acceptable for high-frequency, theologically significant particle
