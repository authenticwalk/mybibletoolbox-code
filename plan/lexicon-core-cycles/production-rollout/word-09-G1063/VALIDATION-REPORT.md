## Quality Highlights

### Exceptional Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Functional Documentation:** 6 primary functions + discourse grammar perspective + scholarly perspective = most thorough functional analysis
2. **Outstanding Diachronic Breadth:** 7 points spanning Classical Greek to Modern Greek with papyri evidence

- **Genre Distribution Estimates:** Pauline/Narrative/Johannine percentages marked as {llm-cs45} estimates (transparent, appropriate)
- **Some Web Searches Less Productive:** Genre distribution and textual variant searches returned general NT info rather than γάρ-specific data (handled appropriately by marking estimates)

---

## Fabrication Check: NEGATIVE ✅

**Zero fabrication incidents detected:**
- All etymological claims properly sourced
- All frequency data cited or transparently estimated
- All functional categories grounded in authoritative grammars
- All diachronic points based on documented scholarship

G1063 γάρ extraction meets all Cycle 4 validation criteria with exceptional comprehensiveness. The particle-adapted methodology (usage patterns replacing morphology) is exemplary. Discourse grammar integration (Runge) is outstanding. Zero fabrication, complete inline citations, and comprehensive coverage across all dimensions.

**Recommended for production rollout:** ✅ YES
