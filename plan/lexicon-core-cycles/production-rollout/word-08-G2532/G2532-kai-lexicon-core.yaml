# ETYMOLOGY
# ============================================================================
etymology:
  classification: "Primary particle, having a copulative and sometimes also a cumulative force" #{blb-strongs}
  historical_origin: "Apparently a primary particle without clear derivation from other Greek roots; functions as fundamental connective element from earliest Greek" #{perseus-smyth}
  semantic_core: "Links items of equal status; connects equal elements—whether single words, phrases, clauses, or whole large chunks of text—together in an addition-like fashion" #{runge-dg}
  etymological_note: "Unlike some particles (e.g., δέ from δή), καί shows no clear etymological connection to other Greek forms, suggesting its primacy in the language system" #{llm-cs45}

  textual_variant_patterns:
    stability: "καί is generally stable across textual traditions due to high frequency and clarity of function" #{llm-cs45}
    variation_types: "Most variants involve καί vs. δέ substitutions or presence/absence of καί in series" #{llm-cs45}
    critical_significance: "Variants rarely affect meaning significantly; more about stylistic preference than theological content" #{llm-cs45}
    crasis_forms: "Occasional variants in crasis forms (κἀγώ vs. καὶ ἐγώ) without semantic difference" #{llm-cs45}

# ============================================================================
# PEDAGOGICAL INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
pedagogical_insights:
  - insight: "καί's overwhelming frequency (9,153 occurrences) makes it the single most important particle for NT reading fluency"
    teaching_value: "Students must master καί's range to read NT naturally; drilling copulative, adverbial, and ascensive functions essential" #{llm-cs45}

  - insight: "καί's semantic simplicity (links equal items) contrasts with translation complexity (and/also/even/but/then)"
    teaching_value: "Helps students distinguish Greek semantics from English glosses; one Greek word ≠ one English word" #{llm-cs45}

  - insight: "Understanding καί vs. δέ distinction (cumulative vs. developmental) improves discourse analysis"
    teaching_value: "Discourse grammar approach clarifies why translations vary; context determines force, not particle alone" #{runge-dg}

  - insight: "καί...καί correlative construction (both...and) emphasizes inclusion and equality of elements"
    teaching_value: "Essential for understanding Trinitarian formulas, comprehensive lists, and emphatic coordination" #{llm-cs45}

  - insight: "LXX's heavy καί usage (translating Hebrew waw) creates NT's characteristic narrative rhythm"
    teaching_value: "Understanding Hebrew-Greek translation patterns explains NT's 'and...and...and' style" #{llm-cs45}
