## Weaknesses / Areas for Potential Improvement

### Minor Limitations
1. **LXX occurrence count:** Not provided (source doesn't list it; requires LXX concordance)
   - Mitigation: Noted as "requires further research {llm-cs45}"
   - Impact: Minimal - Hebrew equivalents and translation pattern documented

2. **Frequency ranking:** Estimated ("top 100 NT words") rather than precise
   - Mitigation: Clearly marked as estimate
   - Impact: Minimal - precise ranking less important than theological significance

3. **Percentage estimations:** Some semantic categories have estimated frequencies (e.g., "75-80%")
   - Mitigation: Clearly marked as estimates, based on usage context analysis
   - Impact: None - within acceptable scholarly practice
