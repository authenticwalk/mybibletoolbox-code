- **Critical systems**: Japanese, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian
- **Significant systems**: Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Tagalog
- **Minor/emerging**: Hebrew, Arabic, Sanskrit

## Implementation Considerations for TBTA

### Data Structure Needs

```yaml
language:
  code: jpn
  name: Japanese
  honorific_system: true
  features:
    - age_based_honorifics
    - social_status_markers
    - politeness_levels
    - gender_speech_differences

  levels:
    formal:
      description: "Keigo system, honorific and humble forms"
      use_cases: [authority_address, elderly, strangers, formal_contexts]

    standard:
      description: "Polite forms with -masu/-desu"
      use_cases: [general_conversation, educated_speech, neutral_tone]

    casual:
      description: "Kudaketa, familiar forms"
      use_cases: [peers, friends, family, informal_contexts]

  sociolinguistic_markers:
    - age_differential: "Critical - requires register shift"
    - status_relationship: "Critical - requires form selection"
    - gender: "Significant - affects particle and verb choice"
    - context: "Important - formal settings require keigo"
```

### Translation Quality Checkpoints

1. **Age Verification**: Are character relationships honored in register selection?
2. **Status Confirmation**: Do authority figures and subordinates use appropriate forms?
3. **Politeness Appropriateness**: Does register match the situation and social context?
4. **Gender Consistency**: Are gender-based speech patterns appropriately applied (where relevant)?
5. **Cultural Authenticity**: Does translation reflect target culture's actual speech norms?

### Tool Development Priorities

Based on language complexity and coverage in TBTA:

**Phase 1** (Highest Priority):
- Japanese (jpn) - Most complex, most documentation available
- Korean (kor) - Equally complex, critical for East Asian audience
- Mandarin Chinese (cmn) - Large audience, moderate complexity

**Phase 2** (High Priority):
- Thai (tha) - Significant complexity, important Southeast Asian language
- Vietnamese (vie) - Moderate complexity, large audience
- Indonesian (ind) - Less complex but important regional language

**Phase 3** (Medium Priority):
- Hindi (hin) - Large audience, moderate complexity
- Bengali (ben) - Large audience, moderate complexity
- Dravidian languages (tam, tel, mal) - Moderate complexity, South Asian importance

**Phase 4** (Reference/Research):
- Hebrew (heb) - Already present in Biblical texts
- Arabic (arb) - Complex but diglossic situation complicates implementation
- Tagalog (tgl) - Growing Philippine Christian market
- Sanskrit (san) - Academic/scholarly value

### Notes for Tool Creators

1. **Reference Biblical parallels**: When in doubt about register appropriateness, check how the original Hebrew/Greek handled similar social relationships

2. **Cultural consultation**: Each language tool should ideally have input from native speakers familiar with both Bible and that language's register system

3. **Iterative validation**: Register systems are culturally nuanced - tools should include feedback mechanisms for community validation

4. **Documentation requirements**: Every register system needs:
   - Clear examples from existing translations
   - Guidance on character differentiation
   - Age/status relationship matrices
   - Particle/affix usage patterns
   - Context appropriateness guidelines

5. **Edge cases**: Religious/sacred language often follows different rules:
   - Prayer language may use archaic forms
   - Divine address may use unique registers
   - Prophetic language may transcend normal social rules
   - These need explicit documentation per language
