## Implementation Notes for Tool Development

### Language Metadata Required
For each language in our TSV, we should capture:

```
{
  "code": "spa",
  "language": "Spanish",
  "family": "Indo-European",
  "pro_drop_type": "high",
  "pro_drop_persons": ["1sg", "2sg", "3sg", "1pl", "2pl", "3pl"],
  "object_realization": "clitic",
  "clitic_obligatory": true,
  "clitic_placement": "before_or_after_verb",
  "focus_driven": false,
  "switch_reference": false,
  "agreement_richness": "rich",
  "notes": "Subject drop all persons; obligatory clitics for objects"
}
```

### Validation Approach
1. Start with well-documented language families (Romance, Germanic, East Asian)
2. Use existing linguistic descriptions for medium-sized families
3. Flag Trans-New Guinea, Austronesian variants for expert review
4. Collect native speaker feedback on tool predictions
5. Adjust based on corpus analysis of actual Bible translations

### Priority Languages for Initial Tool Testing
Based on concentration in TSV and importance for Bible translation:

1. **Spanish** (spa) - 50+ million speakers, well-documented
2. **Portuguese** (por) - 200+ million speakers, well-documented
3. **English** (eng) - Source language, non-pro-drop baseline
4. **Mandarin Chinese** (zho) - Large speaker base, well-documented
5. **Japanese** (jpn) - Well-documented, useful contrast
6. **French** (fra) - Well-documented, limited pro-drop interest
7. **Russian** (rus) - Limited pro-drop, interesting asymmetry
8. **Tagalog** (tgl) - Focus system example

## Research Directions

### Needed Language-Specific Investigations
1. Formal grammar descriptions for Trans-New Guinea languages
2. Clitic placement rules for Balkan languages
3. Focus structure in Philippine languages
4. Switch-reference + pro-drop interactions
5. Register variation in pro-drop languages

### Corpus Analysis Needed
1. Compare English Bible translation with Spanish translation (pro-drop differences)
2. Analyze Japanese Bible translation (extensive zero use)
3. Compare Romance language translations (clitic strategies)
4. Study Mandarin translation corpus

### Native Speaker Testing
1. Validation of pro-drop naturalness in target languages
2. Register appropriateness judgments
3. Clitic vs. full noun choice preferences
4. Zero vs. pronoun naturalness ratings

## Document Summary

This document provides the foundation for:
- Language-specific surface realization prediction
- Systematic language family analysis
- Priority ordering for tool development
- Research direction planning
- Validation framework design

For each language in the TSV, translators and tool developers can:
1. Find their language's pro-drop type
2. Understand family-level patterns
3. Apply appropriate surface realization rules
4. Design language-specific validation tests
