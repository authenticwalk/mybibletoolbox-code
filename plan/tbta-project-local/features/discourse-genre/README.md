# Discourse Genre in TBTA

## Overview

Discourse Genre is a clause-level feature that marks the type and functional purpose of text passages. Unlike grammatical features that describe linguistic structure, genre operates at the discourse level to indicate the communicative intent, register, and conventions of different sections of the Bible. This feature is critical for languages whose grammar varies significantly by text type.

## Definition

**Discourse Genre**: The category of discourse or text type that governs register, syntax, discourse markers, and stylistic choices in a target language translation.

**Position**: Clause-level property (applied to main clauses that establish discourse sections)

**Frequency**: Present in most clauses, but marked only when establishing a new genre section

## Genre Values in TBTA

The TBTA system recognizes 9 distinct discourse genres:

### 1. Climactic Narrative Story
- **Description**: Main storyline action; central narrative events
- **Characteristics**:
  - Primary action sequence moving the narrative forward
  - Events crucial to plot development
  - Foreground narrative content
  - Typically past tense or narrative present
- **Language Implications**:
  - Many languages reserve specific verb forms for main narrative
  - Bantu languages use "foreground" tenses for this genre
  - May require different discourse markers than background narrative
- **Example Contexts**:
  - Gospel narratives of Jesus's ministry
  - Apostolic acts and miraculous events
  - Climactic moments in parables

### 2. Background Narrative
- **Description**: Supporting narrative providing context or scene-setting
- **Characteristics**:
  - Provides temporal, spatial, or circumstantial context
  - Events less central to main plot
  - Often introduces participants or settings
  - May use different aspectual marking
- **Language Implications**:
  - Some languages mark background differently from foreground
  - May require backgrounded tenses or particles
  - Often uses imperfect or habitual tense in many European languages
- **Example Contexts**:
  - Setting descriptions ("Now it came to pass...")
  - Character introductions and background
  - Historical context or genealogies
  - Scene-setting for events

### 3. Procedural
- **Description**: Instructions, directions, or how-to sequences
- **Characteristics**:
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Prescriptive actions without necessary temporal order
  - Often imperative or modal
  - Goal-oriented instruction
- **Language Implications**:
  - May require special procedural markers or particles
  - Often uses imperative or gnomic (timeless) present
  - Some languages use special procedure-marking tenses
- **Example Contexts**:
  - Levitical laws and ritual instructions
  - Jesus's instructions to disciples
  - Procedural elements in legal texts

### 4. Expository
- **Description**: Teaching, explanation, or doctrinal content
- **Characteristics**:
  - Explanation of concepts or theology
  - Teaching material (parables, sermons)
  - Didactic rather than narrative
  - Timeless or generic statements
- **Language Implications**:
  - May use habitual or gnomic present tense
  - Different register from narrative
  - May require special discourse particles for teaching
  - Some languages use different verb agreement
- **Example Contexts**:
  - Jesus's teachings and parables
  - Paul's epistolary teaching
  - Wisdom literature teachings
  - Commentary and explanation

### 5. Poetic
- **Description**: Poetry, songs, hymns, and poetic literature
- **Characteristics**:

### 7. Prophetic
- **Description**: Prophecy, divinely-given utterance, and oracular discourse
- **Characteristics**:
  - Claims divine authority or inspiration
  - Often uses "says the Lord" or similar framing
  - May use special prophetic markers
  - Frequently contains imperatives and declarations
- **Language Implications**:
  - May require special prophetic particles or registers
  - Some languages have dedicated prophetic tense/mood
  - Often uses elevated register or archaic forms
  - May require special discourse boundary markers
- **Example Contexts**:
  - Prophetic books (Isaiah, Jeremiah, etc.)
  - Oracular pronouncements
  - Visions and apocalyptic content

- **Example Contexts**:
  - Pauline epistles (Romans, Corinthians, etc.)
  - Letter openings and closings
  - Epistolary greetings and benedictions

## Why Discourse Genre Matters

### 1. Register and Formality
Languages vary significantly in the registers they employ for different genres. What is appropriate for everyday narrative may be completely wrong for legal text or poetry.

**Example**:
- Japanese has distinct registers for informal narrative vs. formal teaching vs. poetic language
- Many African languages distinguish narrative registers from expository registers
- Romance languages vary formality levels by genre

### 2. Tense and Aspect Systems
Many languages have specialized tense/aspect forms for specific genres:

- **Narrative tenses**: Dedicated forms for main narrative action
- **Backgrounding tenses**: Forms for descriptive/background material
- **Timeless/Gnomic**: Special forms for teaching and expository material
- **Procedural tenses**: Forms for instructions

**Example**:
- French has passé simple (main narrative) vs. imparfait (background)
- Bantu languages use different tenses for foreground vs. background narrative
- Mandarin uses different aspect particles for narrative vs. teaching

### 3. Discourse Particles and Markers
Genre determines which discourse particles, conjunctions, and transitional phrases are appropriate:

**Example**:
- Hebrew uses wayyiqtol for narrative but qatal for poetry and teaching
- Japanese uses narrative particles (ぞ, かな) differently in narrative vs. expository text
- English uses "and then" for narrative but "therefore" for exposition

### 4. Stylistic and Syntactic Choices
Different genres license different sentence structures and stylistic patterns:

**Example**:
- Poetry may permit unusual word order for metrical reasons
- Legal language uses formulaic conditional structures
- Epistolary language uses vocatives and direct address prominently

### 5. Vocabulary Selection
Genre can determine lexical choices, even for the same semantic content:

**Example**:
- Legal genre may require technical legal terminology
- Poetic genre permits or requires figurative language
- Teaching genre may use metaphors or simplified vocabulary

## Linguistic Features by Genre

   - Use formulaic language patterns

9. **Epistolary**
   - Follow letter conventions for your language
   - Use appropriate salutation and closing forms
   - Employ direct address and vocatives
   - Use epistolary-specific particles/markers

## Language Examples

### Japanese
Japanese exemplifies genre-specific marking:
- **Narrative**: Uses ~ta (past perfect) for main events
- **Background**: Uses ~ita (progressive past) for descriptive context
- **Teaching**: Uses ~i adjectives for timeless statements
- **Formal/Letter**: Uses -desu/masu politeness levels
- **Poetry**: Uses classical/archaic forms and special particles

### Bantu Languages (e.g., Swahili)
Bantu languages show extensive genre specialization:
- **Main Narrative**: Uses Simple Past tense (perfective)
- **Background**: Uses Continuous Past (imperfective)
- **Setting**: Uses Generic/Habitual tenses
- **Teaching**: Uses Timeless Present
- **Formal/Legal**: Uses special formal registers

### French
Romance languages show genre distinctions through tense:
- **Main Narrative**: Passé simple (simple past) or Passé composé
- **Background/Narration**: Imparfait (imperfect)
- **Expository**: Présent (timeless present)
- **Conditional**: Conditionnel (for hypotheticals/legal)

### Hebrew
The Biblical language itself demonstrates genre marking:
- **Narrative**: Uses wayyiqtol (consecutive imperfect) for main events
- **Background**: Uses regular qatal/yiqtol
- **Poetry**: Uses elevated register and metaphor
- **Law**: Uses infinitive construct and imperatives in formal patterns
- **Prophecy**: Uses yiqtol with prophetic force

## Data Structure Integration

Discourse Genre appears at the clause level:

```yaml
# Example: Matthew 24:1-2 (Climactic Narrative transitioning to Background)

Verse: MAT.024.001
Discourse Genre: Climactic Narrative Story
Part: Clause
Illocutionary Force: Declarative
Constituents:
  - Constituent: Jesus
    Part: NP
    ...
  - Constituent: answered
    Part: VP
    ...

Verse: MAT.024.002
Discourse Genre: Background Narrative  # Setting description
Part: Clause
Illocutionary Force: Declarative
Constituents:
  - Constituent: stone
    Part: NP
    ...
```
