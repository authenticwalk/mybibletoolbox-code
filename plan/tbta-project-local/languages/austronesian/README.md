## Classification and Subgroupings

### Primary Division

The Austronesian family divides into two major branches:

1. **Formosan Languages** (Taiwan)
   - 9-10 primary branches
   - 14 surviving aboriginal languages
   - Greatest linguistic diversity within smallest geographic area
   - Each branch coordinate with entire Malayo-Polynesian family

2. **Malayo-Polynesian** (All languages outside Taiwan)
   - ~1,200 languages
   - 385.5 million speakers
   - Spreads from Madagascar to Easter Island

### Major Malayo-Polynesian Subgroups

#### Western Malayo-Polynesian
- **Philippine languages** (Tagalog, Cebuano, Ilocano, etc.)
- **Indonesian-Malay languages** (Indonesian, Javanese, Sundanese)
- **Languages of Borneo** (Iban, Kadazan, etc.)
- **Malagasy** (Madagascar)
- **Cham languages** (mainland Southeast Asia)
- **Languages of Sulawesi**

#### Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian
- **Central Malayo-Polynesian** (eastern Indonesia)
- **Eastern Malayo-Polynesian**
  - South Halmahera-West New Guinea (~45 languages)
  - **Oceanic** (~450 languages)
    - Western Oceanic (Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands)
    - Central-Eastern Oceanic
      - Micronesian
      - Southeast Solomonic
      - Vanuatu-New Caledonian
      - Fijian-Polynesian
      - **Polynesian** (Hawaiian, Tahitian, Maori, Samoan, Tongan)

## Common Grammatical Features

### 1. Number Systems

#### Basic Numbers
Austronesian languages typically distinguish:
- **Singular**: one item
- **Plural**: multiple items (often unmarked or marked with particles like Tagalog "mga")

#### Extended Number Systems
Many Oceanic languages have elaborate number systems:
- **Dual**: exactly two ('we two', 'you two', 'the two of them')
- **Trial**: exactly three (found in Tolomako, Lihir, Manam, Bislama, Tok Pisin)
- **Paucal**: a few (3-5 items)

Proto-Austronesian had two sets of numbers:
- Unreduplicated: *esa 'one,' *duSa 'two,' *telu 'three' (for objects)
- Reduplicated: *a-esa, *da-duSa, *ta-telu (for counting humans)

### 2. Person and Clusivity

#### Inclusive vs. Exclusive "We"
Nearly universal in Austronesian languages:
- **Inclusive**: includes the listener ("you and I/we")
- **Exclusive**: excludes the listener ("we but not you")

Examples:
- Malay: "kita" (inclusive) vs. "kami" (exclusive)
- Chamorro: "ta" (inclusive) vs. "in" (exclusive)
- Tagalog: "tayo" (inclusive) vs. "kami" (exclusive)

#### Special Forms
- Many Philippine languages have dual inclusive ("you and me")
- Some languages combine clusivity with number:
  - Melanesian pidgins: "yumitupela" (inclusive dual), "mipela" (exclusive plural)

### 3. Voice/Focus Systems

#### Symmetrical Voice (Austronesian Alignment)
The most distinctive feature of many Austronesian languages:
- Multiple voice types determine which semantic role is the "subject/topic"
- Not a simple active/passive distinction

#### Voice Types (Philippine-type languages)
1. **Actor Voice (AV)**: Agent is the subject
   - Tagalog affixes: -um-, mag-, mang-, ma-
2. **Patient Voice (PV)**: Patient/object is the subject
   - Tagalog affixes: -in-, i-, -an
3. **Locative Voice (LV)**: Location is the subject
4. **Benefactive Voice (BV)**: Beneficiary is the subject
5. **Instrument Voice (IV)**: Instrument is the subject
6. **Reason Voice (RV)**: Reason/cause is the subject

#### Indonesian-type vs. Philippine-type
- **Philippine-type**: Retains 3-4 voices from Proto-Austronesian
- **Indonesian-type**: Reduced to 2 voices (active/passive-like)
- **Post-Indonesian**: May develop ergative-absolutive alignment

### 4. Aspect vs. Tense

#### Realis-Irrealis Modal Distinction
Primary organizing principle in many Austronesian TAM systems:
- **Realis**: Events that have occurred or are occurring
  - Past events
  - Present states
  - Factual statements
- **Irrealis**: Virtual/potential events
  - Future
  - Hypothetical
  - Commands
  - Wishes

#### Aspectual Distinctions
- **Completive**: Action completed (often unmarked)
- **Non-completive**: Ongoing/habitual (often marked by CV reduplication)
- **Perfect**: Completed with current relevance
- **Imperfective**: Ongoing or habitual

#### Tense as Secondary
- Tense often emerges from aspect + mood combinations
- In realis mood: perfective → past, imperfective → present
- In irrealis mood: neutral or future orientation

## How These Features Affect Bible Translation

### 1. Voice System Challenges

#### Participant Tracking
- Austronesian voice systems allow flexible word order while maintaining clarity about who does what
- Biblical Hebrew/Greek active-passive doesn't map directly to 6-voice systems
- Translators must decide which voice best highlights the intended focus

#### Agency and Responsibility
- Actor voice vs. patient voice can shift emphasis on responsibility
- Example: "Judas betrayed Jesus" (actor focus) vs. "Jesus was betrayed by Judas" (patient focus) carry different pragmatic weights

#### Discourse Patterns
- Patient voice often predominates in narrative (60-70% in some languages)
- Biblical narrative patterns may need restructuring to sound natural

### 2. Pronoun System Challenges

#### Clusivity in Dialogue
- Biblical "we" must be analyzed: does it include the addressee?
- Example: When Paul says "we," does he mean:
  - "We apostles" (exclusive)
  - "We believers including you" (inclusive)
  - Context determines translation choice

#### Number Specification
- Languages with dual/trial require specific decisions
- "Two or three witnesses" may use different grammatical forms
- Groups in narrative need precise number marking

### 3. Temporal System Challenges

#### Realis-Irrealis in Prophecy
- Prophetic perfect in Hebrew: past tense for future certainty
- Must decide: translate as realis (certain) or irrealis (future)
- Theological implications of modal choices

#### Aspect in Narrative
- Greek aspect (perfective/imperfective) doesn't map directly
- Completed vs. ongoing actions need careful analysis
- Reduplication patterns may affect word rhythm and memorability

### 4. Cultural and Conceptual Challenges

#### Metaphor Translation
- Maritime cultures: fishing metaphors resonate
- Island contexts: "casting mountains into sea" is vivid
- Agricultural mainland metaphors may need adaptation

#### Social Hierarchy
- Many Austronesian cultures have elaborate honorific systems
- Biblical direct address to God needs cultural sensitivity
- Respect language affects prayer and worship translations

### 5. Specific Translation Strategies

#### For Voice Systems
1. Analyze the discourse function, not just syntax
2. Consider information flow and topic continuity
3. Use voice to maintain participant tracking
4. Respect natural discourse patterns of the target language

#### For Pronouns
1. Study context carefully for clusivity decisions
2. Use footnotes for ambiguous cases
3. Consider dual forms for pairs (disciples, two witnesses)
4. Be consistent within pericopes

#### For Temporal Systems
1. Prioritize modal distinctions over tense
2. Use aspect to convey narrative development
3. Consider realis for divine promises (certainty)
4. Maintain consistency in prophetic passages

## Conclusion

The Austronesian language family presents unique challenges and opportunities for Bible translation. Understanding the common features—particularly voice systems, elaborate pronoun systems with clusivity and number distinctions, and aspect-prominent temporal systems—is essential for producing accurate, natural, and meaningful translations. The concentration of these languages in Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, and Indonesia suggests these regions should be priority areas for specialized training and resource development.

The typological distance between Austronesian languages and Biblical source languages (Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek) requires translators to make complex decisions about information structure, participant tracking, and modal distinctions. Success requires deep understanding of both the source texts and the target language's natural discourse patterns.
