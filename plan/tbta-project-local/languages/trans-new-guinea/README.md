# Trans-New Guinea Languages Research

## Overview

Trans-New Guinea (TNG) is one of the world's largest language families by number of languages. The language family spans across Papua New Guinea and parts of Indonesia, with an estimated 300-500 discrete languages and hundreds of highly divergent dialects serving approximately 3 million speakers.

This document summarizes key linguistic features of TNG languages and their implications for Bible translation through the TBTA (Trans-Bible Translation Associate) project.

## Language Count in Project

**Total TNG languages in mybibletoolbox**: 153 languages

These languages are distributed across Papua New Guinea (primary) and Indonesia (secondary locations).

## Core Linguistic Features

### 1. Switch Reference Systems

**Definition**: A grammatical mechanism that marks whether the subject of one clause is the same as or different from the subject of the next clause in a clause chain.

**Markers**: Typically marked as:
- **SS (Same Subject)**: Indicates subject continuity
- **DS (Different Subject)**: Indicates subject change

**Characteristics**:
- Present in approximately 72% of Papua New Guinea languages
- Employed to track topicality and discourse coherence across multiple clauses
- Medial verbs in clause chains morphologically indicate co-reference or disjoint reference
- Final verbs provide morphosemantic information like tense, mood, or illocutionary force

**Prevalence in TNG**: Switch reference is a defining characteristic of the Trans-New Guinea family and is significantly less common in other language families worldwide, making it a key typological feature.

### 2. Evidentiality

**Definition**: Grammatical marking of the source or type of evidence for a statement (what the speaker knows and how they know it).

**Distribution in TNG Languages**:
- **Limited distribution**: Only found in specific subgroups, not widespread across entire family
- **Geographic concentration**: Most heavily attested in Papua New Guinea Highlands region
- **Family membership**: Present in Ok-Oksapmin, Duna-Bogaia, Engan, East and West Kutubuan, and Bosavi families within TNG

**Types of Evidential Systems**:
- **Minimal systems**: Mark single categories (reported, non-firsthand, or inferred)
- **Maximal systems**: Mark five or more categories (visual, non-visual sensory, inferred, reasoning, factual/participatory, reported)

**Special Features**:
- Morphologically expressed through verbal inflections
- Complex relationship between person, information source, and temporal reference
- Includes underexplored category of "participatory evidentiality"
- Marks the "perceiver" role implied by evidential markers

**Highlands-Specific Characteristics**:
- Rich and varied systems with significant regional variation
- Often interact with tense and aspect marking
- Complex treatment of direct versus indirect evidentials

### 3. Complex Verb Morphology

**Subject and Object Agreement**:
- Subject agreement marked through suffixation
- Object agreement marked through prefixation (characteristic pattern: 1st person singular /n-/, 2nd person singular velar stop)
- Medial verb suffixes indicate subject coreference in clause chaining
- Some languages also mark indirect objects with affixes

**Aspectual Marking**:
- Aspect is central to verb systems
- Many verbs exhibit distinction between perfective and imperfective stems
- Aspect morphology can be extensive with complex paradigms

**Tense and Mood Marking**:
- Tense and mood marked through verbal morphology
- Future tense typically marked with verbal suffixes and irrealis meaning
- Mood indicates likelihood or possibility of action

**Additional Verbal Information**:
- Direction and location of action
- Temporal coordinates
- Example: Yimas *na-pay-wi-ŋka-pu-kia-ntut* = "he first went away up at night"

**Structural Diversity**:
- Ranges from mildly polysynthetic to almost isolating
- Verb inventories can be highly reduced (some languages have only 60-100 verb roots)
- Extensive use of serial verb constructions and light-verb constructions to increase expressive power

**General Characteristics**:
- Verbs clearly distinguished from nouns grammatically and morphologically
- V-V compounding and serialization common
- Valency-changing operations (causatives, applicatives) widespread
- Often involve affixation or verb serialization

## Translation Implications

### Switch Reference Challenges

1. **Clause Chaining Complexity**: TNG languages extensively use clause chains with explicit subject-tracking morphology, while biblical source languages (Greek, Hebrew) use different discourse structures. This requires translators to:
   - Map implicit relationships in source languages to explicit SS/DS marking
   - Decide whether to maintain original discourse structure or adapt to target language norms
   - Ensure narrative coherence across extended clause chains

2. **Discourse Structure Adaptation**: The storyteller's method of narrating events depends heavily on pragmatic features of the local language. Original biblical narratives may need restructuring to properly use the target language's preferred clause-chaining patterns.

3. **Topicality Tracking**: Accurate switch reference marking is essential for maintaining clear topical relationships, which directly affects reader comprehension in cultures that rely on grammatical marking for discourse tracking.

### Evidentiality Challenges

1. **Epistemological Questions**: Languages with grammaticalized evidentiality force explicit decisions about:
   - How to mark creation accounts (Genesis 1-2)
   - How to mark theological statements ("God is good")
   - Whether reported speech requires specific evidential marking
   - How to distinguish between narrative accounts and divine communication

2. **Authority and Source Marking**: Bible translation must navigate:
   - What evidential to use for Gospels (eyewitness accounts vs. transmitted tradition)
   - How to mark Old Testament narratives translated into a language that requires evidential marking
   - Whether different books should use different evidential paradigms
   - Precedent from previous translations (e.g., Quechua use of direct experience evidential for Gospel accounts)

3. **Cultural-Linguistic Mismatch**: In many evidential systems, inferential or hearsay evidentials carry connotations of lesser certainty, which may be inappropriate for biblical material expected to convey certainty and authority.

### Complex Verb Morphology Challenges

1. **Polysynthetic Requirements**: Languages requiring extensive verbal agreement may need:
   - Multiple morphemes per verb to convey information easily expressed analytically in English
   - Precise alignment of agreement features between verbs in serial constructions
   - Careful handling of object and indirect object marking with multiple participants

2. **Serial Verb Constructions**: Languages with limited verb roots (60-100 total) require:
   - Use of serial verb construction for abstract concepts
   - Decomposition of complex Greek/Hebrew verbs into multiple component verbs
   - Consistency in how particular semantic fields are expressed through verb serialization

3. **Aspect-Tense Interaction**: Bible translation must accurately convey:
   - Perfective vs. imperfective distinctions not always clearly marked in source texts
   - Temporal sequences through proper aspectual marking
   - Relationship between modality (possibility, necessity) and tense in source language

4. **Reduced Vocabulary**: Languages with small verb inventories require:
   - Strategic use of serialization for biblical events
   - Consistent semantic mapping of Greek/Hebrew verbs to limited local verb inventory
   - Potential need for borrowed terms or new compound forms

## Structural and Typological Context

### Language Family Position

Trans-New Guinea languages represent:
- Third-largest language family in the world by number of languages
- Right-headed language family (unlike Austronesian which is left-headed)
- Characterized by complex, polysynthetic to isolating morphological diversity
- Predominantly located in interior highlands and coastal areas of Papua New Guinea

### Proto-Language Evidence

Key evidence for genetic relationship:
- Object marking through verbal prefixes (1st sg. /n-/, 2nd sg. velar stop)
- Pattern of co-occurrence across geographically distant languages suggests inheritance from proto-language
- Likelihood of such patterns being borrowed is vanishingly small, providing strong genetic relationship evidence

### Phonological Characteristics

Proto-Trans-New Guinea reconstructions suggest:
- Obstruent system similar to many world languages
- Phonological patterns enabling complex morphological concatenation
- Regional variation in phonological inventory
