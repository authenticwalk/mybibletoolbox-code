PREDICTIONS MADE
================================================================================

Matthew 24:46:
  servant     → Routine      (HIGH confidence)
  lord        → Routine      (HIGH confidence)
  he          → Routine      (HIGH confidence)

Matthew 24:47:
  he          → Routine      (HIGH confidence)
  him         → Routine      (HIGH confidence)
  goods       → Frame Inferable (MEDIUM confidence)

TOTAL ENTITIES ANALYZED: 6
ROUTINE PREDICTIONS: 5
FRAME INFERABLE PREDICTIONS: 1
HIGH CONFIDENCE PREDICTIONS: 5
MEDIUM CONFIDENCE PREDICTIONS: 1

METHOD AGREEMENT: 100%
(All three prediction methods predict identical values)

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

Finding 1: Pronouns Reliably Predict Routine
  All pronouns ("he", "him") in this text consistently predict as Routine
  because they refer to previously established discourse entities.

Finding 2: Possessive Constructions Indicate Frame Inferable
  "his goods" - not explicitly introduced but understood through
  the master's implied authority, wealth, and social status.

Finding 3: Three Methods Show 100% Agreement
  - Narrative Flow Method predicts same values
  - Surface Realization Method predicts same values
  - Information Structure Method predicts same values
  This validates our reasoning and increases confidence.

Finding 4: Master/Servant Relationships Show Predictable Patterns
  - Master = established entity (Routine)
  - Specific servant = routine in this parable (already introduced in 24:45)
  - Master's goods = inferrable from social context (Frame Inferable)

================================================================================
PARTICIPANT TRACKING FEATURES TESTED
================================================================================

9 possible values defined in ALL-FEATURES.md:

1. First Mention     - New entity introduced
2. Routine           - Established participant continuing ✓ TESTED
3. Integration       - Being integrated into narrative
4. Exiting           - Leaving the narrative
5. Restaging         - Reintroduced after absence
6. Offstage          - Mentioned but not present
7. Generic           - Generic/non-specific reference
8. Interrogative     - In question context
9. Frame Inferable   - Understood from context ✓ TESTED

Values tested on MAT 24:46-47: Routine, Frame Inferable (2 of 9)
Other values expected in fuller test suite of MAT 24:45-51

================================================================================
METHODOLOGY OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Phase 1: Feature Isolation (THIS EXPERIMENT)
  - Test individual features in controlled context
  - MAT 24:46-47 provides master/servant narrative

Phase 2: Feature Combination (FUTURE)
  - Test how participant tracking interacts with other features
  - Test with complete parable (MAT 24:45-51)

Phase 3: Language-Specific Testing (FUTURE)
  - Apply to specific language families with known needs
  - Test switch-reference languages, honorific systems, etc.

SUCCESS METRICS:
  - Accuracy: % of features correctly predicted
  - Precision: When we predict a value, is it correct?
  - Recall: Do we catch all instances?
  - F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision/recall

TARGET: 80%+ accuracy on MAT 24:46-47

================================================================================
PREDICTION METHODS EXPLAINED
================================================================================

METHOD 1: Discourse Position & Narrative Flow
  Question: Is this entity new, continuing, returning, or leaving?
  Approach: Track entities through narrative timeline
  Best For: Character arcs, complex scenes
  Result for MAT 24:46-47: 5 Routine, 1 Frame Inferable

METHOD 2: Syntactic Surface Realization
  Question: How is entity expressed (noun, pronoun, possessive)?
  Approach: Analyze syntactic form and modifiers
  Best For: Automated predictions, formal specification
  Result for MAT 24:46-47: 5 Routine, 1 Frame Inferable
  Key Pattern: Pronouns → Routine, Possessive → Frame Inferable

METHOD 3: Information Structure & Discourse Grounding
  Question: Is entity explicitly, inferentially, or newly grounded?
  Approach: Ground entities in discourse context
  Best For: Understanding translation implications
  Result for MAT 24:46-47: 5 Routine, 1 Frame Inferable
  Key Pattern: Explicit grounding → Routine, Inferential → Frame Inferable

ALL THREE METHODS: 100% AGREEMENT

================================================================================
WHY PARTICIPANT TRACKING MATTERS FOR TRANSLATION
================================================================================

Critical for Languages With:
  - Switch-reference systems (mark subject changes)
  - Topic/focus marking (highlight key information)
  - Definiteness systems (distinguish new from known)
  - Complex pronoun systems (track relationships)
  - Honorific systems (determine politeness levels)

Languages Needing This Feature:
  - Japanese (wa-ga topic distinction)
  - Korean (topic marking, speech levels)
  - Indonesian/Malay (inclusive/exclusive distinctions)
  - Tagalog (focus marking with ang/ng)
  - Many Native American languages (switch-reference)
  - Bantu languages (participant prominence)
  - Papua New Guinea languages (switch-reference)

Translation Implications for MAT 24:46-47:
  - Indonesian: "servant" vs "that servant" affects determiners
  - Tagalog: Tracking determines aspect/mood/focus markers
  - Switch-reference: Verb suffixes mark same/different subjects
  - Honorific languages: Status affects politeness markers

================================================================================
VALIDATION PLAN
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (REQUIRED):
  ☐ Obtain TBTA annotations for MAT 24:45-51
  ☐ Compare predictions to actual TBTA data
  ☐ Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, F1
  ☐ Document any discrepancies

SHORT-TERM (RECOMMENDED):
  ☐ Test Luke 12:37-38 (similar master/servant theme)
  ☐ Test Genesis 19:31 (family relationships, Frame Inferable)
  ☐ Test cross-verse participant tracking
  ☐ Expand to full parable (MAT 24:45-51)
  ☐ Refine confidence thresholds

LONG-TERM (FUTURE):
  ☐ Test complete feature interactions
  ☐ Test on different language families
  ☐ Build comprehensive prediction system
  ☐ Create translator guidance documents
  ☐ Integrate with other TBTA features

KEY CONCEPTS COVERED
================================================================================

Participant Tracking:
  - How discourse marks entity introduction/continuation
  - Affects translation choices in target languages
  - Critical for languages with definite/indefinite distinctions
  - Important for switch-reference systems

Master/Servant Relationships:
  - Hierarchical relationships create predictable patterns
  - Master = authority figure (Routine)
  - Servant = specific individual (introduced or Routine)
  - Master's possessions = Frame Inferable

Information Structure:
  - Given vs new information in discourse
  - Topic vs focus distinctions
  - How entities are grounded (explicitly, inferentially, or new)
  - Implications for article choice, word order, etc.

Bible Translation Implications:
  - Different verse forms affect translation strategy
  - Participant tracking guides aspect/mood selection
  - Critical for faithful translation to target language
