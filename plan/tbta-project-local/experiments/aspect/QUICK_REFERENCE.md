# TBTA Aspect Quick Reference

## The 9 Aspect Values (TBTA)

| Aspect | English Example | Greek/Hebrew Sense | Key Use |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Unmarked** | "He walked" (default) | No special aspect marking | Most verbs - neutral |
| **Perfective** | "He walked to the store" | Completed, whole action | One-time completed events |
| **Imperfective** | "He was walking" | Ongoing/habitual action | Continuous or repeated past |
| **Progressive** | "He is walking now" | Currently in progress | Active present moment |
| **Iterative** | "He walked repeatedly" | Repeated action sequence | Patterns of repeated acts |
| **Habitual** | "He used to walk daily" | Customary, regular pattern | Regular, repeated behavior |
| **Inceptive** | "He began to walk" | Starting point | Initiation of action |
| **Cessative** | "He stopped walking" | Ending point | Termination of action |
| **Completive** | "He walked completely" | Fully finished/achieved | Total completion/achievement |

## When to Use Each

### UNMARKED
- Default for most narrative verbs
- Simple past/present/future statements
- When aspect isn't semantically relevant
- Most common aspect value

**Examples from MAT 24**:
- "return", "do", "order" - simple narrative actions
- When mood is Indicative and no special aspect needed

### PERFECTIVE
- Single completed actions viewed as a whole
- Telic (goal-oriented) verbs
- "He conquered the city" (viewed as complete)
- Less common in teaching passages

### IMPERFECTIVE
- Ongoing states or actions
- Habitual in past ("used to do")
- Durative ("was doing")
- State verbs (be, stay, sit)
- Common in narrative descriptions

**Examples from MAT 24**:
- "stay" (imperfective - being in a place)
- Teaching about continuing conditions

### PROGRESSIVE
- Currently happening
- "Right now" actions
- Present tense ongoing
- Rare in historical narrative
- Common in living conditions

### ITERATIVE
- Repeated action sequences
- "He visited repeatedly"
- Pattern of similar acts
- Teaching/characterization contexts

### HABITUAL
- Customary, regular pattern
- "Every day he walked"
- "He would always..."
- Teaching about regular behavior
- May appear in conditional clauses

**Example from MAT 24**:
- Describing servants' usual duties
- Characterizing normal practice

### INCEPTIVE
- Beginning/starting point
- "He began/started to..."
- Verb: beat, hit, strike, begin
- Initial phase of action
- Often future/potential mood

**Key Example - MAT.024.049**:
- "The servant will begin to beat"
- Aspect: Inceptive (starting point)
- Mood: 'might' Potential (hypothetical)
- Time: Later Today (near future)

### CESSATIVE
- End/stopping point
- "He stopped/ceased to..."
- Verb: stop, end, cease, finish
- Final phase of action
- Often in transitions

**Example context**:
- "The sun stopped shining" (apocalyptic)
- Stopping an ongoing activity

### COMPLETIVE
- Fully completed/achieved
- Perfect accomplishment
- "He finally completed it"
- Goal was achieved totally
- Rare - more specialized than perfective

## Quick Decision Tree

```
START: Analyzing a verb for aspect

Q1: Is this the DEFAULT/neutral case?
   YES → UNMARKED ✓

Q2: Is the action/state CURRENTLY HAPPENING?
   YES → PROGRESSIVE ✓

Q3: Does the action BEGINNING/STARTING?
   YES → INCEPTIVE ✓

Q4: Does the action END/STOP?
   YES → CESSATIVE ✓

Q5: Is this CUSTOMARY/REGULAR behavior?
   YES → HABITUAL ✓

Q6: Is action COMPLETED viewed as whole?
   YES → PERFECTIVE ✓

Q7: Is action ONGOING/CONTINUOUS?
   YES → IMPERFECTIVE ✓

Q8: Is action REPEATED multiple times?
   YES → ITERATIVE ✓

Q9: Is action FULLY/COMPLETELY achieved?
   YES → COMPLETIVE ✓

If NONE match → UNMARKED (default)
```

## Aspect by Verb Type

### Action Verbs (Telic)
- beat, hit, strike, arrive, build, destroy
- Often: Unmarked, Inceptive, or Cessative
- Can be Perfective if completed

### State Verbs (Atelic)
- be, stay, sit, remain, live
- Often: Unmarked, Imperfective
- Rarely Inceptive/Cessative (unless "become", "cease")

### Process Verbs
- walk, run, talk, work, write
- Flexible: Can be Unmarked, Imperfective, or Habitual
- Context-dependent

### Stative-Oriented Verbs
- love, know, believe, see
- Often Imperfective (describing condition)
- Rarely change aspect

## Red Flags for Aspect Prediction

### Watch for these patterns:

**Inceptive clues**:
- Verbs meaning begin/start/commence
- Potential or conditional mood
- Future time markers
- "Will begin to" structure
- Parable/teaching context with new action

**Cessative clues**:
- Verbs meaning stop/end/cease/finish
- Apocalyptic or transition context
- Negation of ongoing state
- "Will stop" structure

**Habitual clues**:
- Time: Present, generic time, discourse
- Teaching/characterization
- "Every day", "always", "would"
- Conditional clauses about normal practice

**Imperfective clues**:
- State verbs
- Narrative of ongoing situations
- "Was doing" structure
- Multiple participants in same action
- Climactic Narrative genre

**Unmarked clues**:
- Simple narrative progression
- Default case when none of above
- Indicative mood with neutral semantics
- Most common aspect

## Aspect Distribution in Bible Narrative

### Typical Matthew 24 Pattern
- **Unmarked**: ~60-70% (default for simple narrative)
- **Imperfective**: ~15-20% (state descriptions, ongoing)
- **Inceptive**: ~5-10% (beginning actions)
- **Cessative**: ~2-5% (ending actions)
- **Habitual**: ~3-5% (teaching about customs)
- **Perfective/Progressive/Iterative/Completive**: <5% (rare)

### By Genre
- **Climactic Narrative** (MAT 24:1-35):
  - Unmarked (default)
  - Inceptive/Cessative (progression)
  - Few Habitual

- **Teaching/Parable** (MAT 24:36-51):
  - Unmarked (default)
  - Habitual (regular practice)
  - Inceptive/Cessative (hypothetical scenarios)
  - More Imperfective

## Language Implementation Notes

### Slavic Languages (Required Obligatory)
```
Russian example:
- читаю (imperfective present) = am reading/read regularly
- прочитаю (perfective future) = will read (completed)
- начинаю читать = beginning to read (inceptive + imperfective)
```

### Mandarin Chinese (Required)
```
Reading book (aspect markers):
- 读书 (habitual)
- 在读书 (progressive)
- 读过书 (completive/perfect)
```

### African Languages
Many have aspect-tense systems:
- Different forms for perfective vs imperfective
- Some mark habitual distinctly
- Narrative uses specific forms

## Testing Checklist

When predicting aspect:

- [ ] Identify verb type (action/state/process/stative)
- [ ] Check mood (does it affect aspect?)
- [ ] Check time value (does it point to specific aspect?)
- [ ] Check discourse genre (narrative vs teaching?)
- [ ] Check for semantic clues (begin, end, repeat, continue?)
- [ ] Compare to surrounding verbs (consistency check)
- [ ] Apply decision tree above
- [ ] Record prediction BEFORE checking TBTA data
- [ ] Compare and analyze any mismatch
