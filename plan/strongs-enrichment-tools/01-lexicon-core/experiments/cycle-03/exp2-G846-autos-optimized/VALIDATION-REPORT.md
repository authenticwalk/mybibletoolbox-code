### 3.3 Diachronic Frequency Analysis Present (Optimized)
**Status:** ✅ PASS

**Cycle 3 Optimization:** Frequency shifts only (not full semantic development)

**Frequency Trajectory Documented:**

**Classical:**
- Epic: Rare, emphatic only {studylight} {lsj}
- Attic: Contracted forms (ταὐτό, ταὐτόν) {studylight}
- Koine shift: "Much more frequently used" {studylight} {blb}

**NT:**
- Frequency: 5,597 mGNT - one of top 10 most frequent words {blb}
- Functional load: "Expanded from emphatic/reflexive to dominant third-person pronoun in oblique cases" {studylight}

**Semantic Stability:** "HIGH - core grammatical function unchanged across periods" {llm-cs45}

**Cycle 3 Rationale:**
- Grammatical words have stable meanings
- Frequency increase, not semantic development
- Full 4-stage Classical analysis unnecessary (saved 7 min)

**Analysis Depth:** Streamlined but sufficient for grammatical word ✅

---

### 3.4 Fair Use Compliance
