lexical_convergence:
  primary_meaning: "Power, might, strength - specifically inherent ability or capacity to perform"
  lexicons_agreeing: ["strongs", "abbott-smith", "lsj", "helps", "thayer", "mounce"]
  confidence: HIGH
  convergence_summary: "Strong consensus across all lexicons on core meaning of inherent power/ability with two dominant NT applications: (1) miraculous power and mighty works, (2) divine omnipotence and spiritual empowerment. All sources emphasize distinction from mere external force - δύναμις denotes internal transformative capability {strongs} {abbott-smith} {lsj} {helps} {thayer} {mounce} {biblehub}"

lexical_divergence:
  - semantic_area: "Synonym distinctions among power words"
    analysis: "Five related Greek terms occupy distinct semantic fields that English 'power' collapses: βία (G970) = forceful oppressive violence in single deeds; ἰσχύς (G2479) = physical strength as endowment; κράτος (G2904) = manifested relative power, chiefly of God; ἐξουσία (G1849) = authority/delegated liberty of action; ἐνέργεια (G1753) = operative power in exercise. δύναμις occupies middle ground: inherent capacity (not mere endowment like ἰσχύς) that can manifest in action (not merely potential) with focus on ability/capability (not authority like ἐξουσία) {biblehub-synonyms} {studylight-synonyms} {abbott-smith}"
    significance: "Critical for theological precision - conflating these terms obscures NT distinctions between power-types (inherent vs delegated, capacity vs manifestation, ability vs authority)"

  - semantic_area: "Classical vs Koine theological intensification"
    analysis: "LSJ documents extensive classical usage: bodily strength (Homer), philosophical potentiality (Aristotle), mathematical powers (Plato, Euclid), military forces (Herodotus, Thucydides). NT/Koine usage narrows semantic range toward theological/miraculous contexts while maintaining economic idioms (κατὰ/παρὰ/ὑπὲρ δύναμιν). Papyri evidence shows economic usage continued but magical/religious supernatural associations intensified, influencing NT writers {lsj} {studylight-papyri}"
    significance: "Diachronic development shows theological specialization in Koine period - classical breadth gives way to focused religious application"

  - semantic_area: "Explosive power anachronism"
    analysis: "Popular sermon illustration claims δύναμις means explosive power like dynamite, creating false semantic association. Scholarly refutation establishes: (1) time-frame fallacy (1800 year gap), (2) semantic incompatibility (explosions sudden/momentary vs δύναμις enduring/sustained), (3) modern Greek uses different terms for explosions {scribalcafe} {wordstudytools}"
    significance: "Demonstrates danger of etymological fallacy and semantic back-formation - modern scientific naming conventions (Nobel 1867) cannot retroactively define ancient semantic fields"

  - semantic_area: "Pedagogical vs scholarly organization"
    analysis: "HELPS Word-studies emphasizes practical application for believers ('power to achieve by applying the Lord's inherent abilities') and spiritual growth dimension, while traditional lexicons (Abbott-Smith, LSJ, Thayer) organize by grammatical function and semantic categories. Mounce adds student-oriented theological emphasis on administrative supernatural beings {helps} {mounce} vs {abbott-smith} {lsj} {thayer}"
    significance: "Different organizational approaches serve different user needs (devotional/pedagogical vs academic/scholarly)"
