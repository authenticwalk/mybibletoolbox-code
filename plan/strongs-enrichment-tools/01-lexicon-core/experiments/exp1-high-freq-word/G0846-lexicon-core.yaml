lexical_convergence:
  primary_meaning: "Reflexive pronoun and personal pronoun third person"

  confidence: HIGH
  convergence_summary: "Strong consensus across all lexicons on three core functions: (1) reflexive/emphatic 'self', (2) personal pronoun 'he/she/it' in oblique cases, (3) with article 'the same' {strongs} {abbott-smith} {lsj} {mounce}"

lexical_divergence:
  - semantic_area: "Classical vs Koine frequency"
    analysis: "LSJ notes usage was rare in Epic dialect and mostly emphatic, while Abbott-Smith emphasizes much more frequent usage in late Greek (Koine) than classical, particularly in oblique cases for simple third person reference {lsj} {abbott-smith}"
    significance: "Diachronic development shows increased functional load in Koine period"

  - semantic_area: "Pedagogical emphasis"
    analysis: "Mounce emphasizes the pedagogical challenge for students in distinguishing intensified/reflexive usage from standard third-person pronoun function, while traditional lexicons organize by grammatical function {mounce} vs {abbott-smith} {lsj}"
    significance: "Different organizational approaches serve different user needs (students vs scholars)"
