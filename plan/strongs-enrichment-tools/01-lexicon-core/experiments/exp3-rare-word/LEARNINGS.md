## Comparison Questions (Experiments 1, 2, 3)

### 1. How many occurrences?

| Experiment | Word | Occurrences | Classification |
|------------|------|-------------|----------------|
| Exp 1 | G4982 σώζω (save) | 106 | Very common |
| Exp 2 | G1343 δικαιοσύνη (righteousness) | 92 | Common |
| **Exp 3** | **G5287 ὑπόστασις (hypostasis)** | **5** | **Very rare** |

**Analysis**: Successfully tested extreme end of rarity spectrum (5 vs. 92-106).

---

### 2. HELPS/Thayer's/LSJ available despite rarity?

| Source | Exp 1 (σώζω) | Exp 2 (δικαιοσύνη) | **Exp 3 (ὑπόστασις)** | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------|
| HELPS Word-studies | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | **✅ Yes** | **Extensive entry** |
| Thayer's | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | **✅ Yes** | **Detailed treatment** |
| LSJ | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | **✅ Yes** | **MOST DETAILED—philosophical significance** |
| Abbott-Smith | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | **✅ Yes** | Complete |
| Mounce | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | **✅ Yes** | Brief but present |

**Surprising Result**: Web coverage IDENTICAL to common words. Rarity did not reduce scholarly treatment.

**Explanation**: Theological importance drives lexical attention, not frequency alone. Words like ὑπόστασις (Trinity, faith definition) receive disproportionate scholarly focus.

---

### 3. Semantic categories: How many?

| Experiment | Word | Categories | Appropriateness |
|------------|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Exp 1 | σώζω | 8 | Justified by 106 occurrences |
| Exp 2 | δικαιοσύνη | 8 | Justified by 92 occurrences |
| **Exp 3** | **ὑπόστασις** | **2** | **Appropriate for 5 occurrences** |

**Categories for ὑπόστασις**:
1. **Ontological/Substance**: essence, being, real nature (Heb 1:3)
2. **Epistemological/Assurance**: confidence, firm trust, assurance (2 Cor 9:4, 11:17; Heb 3:14, 11:1)

**Success Indicator**: Resisted temptation to create 8 categories. Limited to what 5 occurrences can legitimately support.

---

### 4. Did we resist fabricating elaborate analysis?

**✅ YES - Critical Success**

**Evidence of Restraint**:
- Limited to 2 semantic categories (not 8)
- Explicit rarity notice in usage_statistics section
- Confidence markers (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) used throughout
- Acknowledged uncertainty: "Limited occurrences prevent comprehensive semantic analysis"
- All biblical examples documented (all 5 occurrences accounted for)
- No invented usage contexts beyond documented instances

**Temptations Resisted**:
- Creating nuanced subcategories unsupported by data
- Fabricating usage patterns from 5 examples
- Over-analyzing contextual variations
- Inventing semantic development stages without evidence

**Methodology**:
- Focused on QUALITY of lexical sources (HELPS, Thayer's, LSJ) over QUANTITY of usage
- Leveraged classical Greek usage (LSJ) to supplement sparse NT data
- Emphasized theological significance to explain why 5 occurrences matter
- Cross-referenced related words to provide context

---

### 5. Web coverage: Same as Exp 2 or reduced?

**SAME AS EXP 2** - No reduction despite 95% fewer occurrences (5 vs. 92)

**Coverage Comparison**:

| Source | Exp 2 (δικαιοσύνη - 92x) | **Exp 3 (ὑπόστασις - 5x)** | Difference |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|
| BibleHub | Comprehensive | **Comprehensive** | None |
| StudyLight | Multiple lexicons | **Multiple lexicons** | None |
| Blue Letter Bible | Full entry | **Full entry** | None |
| HELPS | Detailed | **Detailed** | None |
| Thayer's | Present | **Present** | None |
| LSJ | Present | **MORE EXTENSIVE** | ὑπόστασις favored! |

**Counterintuitive Finding**: LSJ entry for ὑπόστασις MORE detailed than for δικαιοσύνη because of philosophical/theological significance.

**Implication**: **Theological importance > statistical frequency** for lexical coverage.

---

### 6. Extraction value: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW

**Extraction Value: HIGH** (same as common words)

**Value Drivers**:
1. **Theological Significance**: Trinity (Heb 1:3), faith definition (Heb 11:1)
2. **Philosophical Background**: Rich classical Greek usage (Aristotle, Stoics)
3. **Historical Impact**: Adopted by Cappadocian Fathers (4th century) for orthodox Trinitarian formulation
4. **English Derivatives**: "hypostasis," "hypostatic union" (theology terms)
5. **Scholarly Attention**: Extensive lexical treatment despite rarity

**Extraction Richness**:
- Etymology: ✅ Complete (ὑπό + ἵστημι)
- Semantic development: ✅ Traced from classical to NT period
- Theological themes: ✅ Comprehensive (Christology, faith, perseverance)
- Translation considerations: ✅ Nuanced (dual semantic range)
- Related words: ✅ Cross-referenced (Greek and Hebrew)
- English derivatives: ✅ Documented with theological context

**Comparison to Common Words**:
- G5287 (5x): HIGH extraction value
- G1343 (92x): HIGH extraction value
- G4982 (106x): HIGH extraction value

**Conclusion**: Rarity does NOT reduce extraction value for theologically significant words.

- LSJ: Extensive classical Greek usage extracted
- HELPS: Theological insights captured
- Thayer's: Philosophical background noted
- All 5 biblical occurrences analyzed

**Status**: PASS ✅

---

### ✅ Marks confidence LOW where appropriate
**Evidence**: Confidence markers used throughout:
- `confidence: HIGH` - Etymology, well-attested meanings
- `confidence: MEDIUM` - 2 Cor usage (less theologically central), cross-language Hebrew equivalents
- Translation challenges acknowledged: "Some uncertainty remains about nuances"

**Status**: PASS ✅

---

### ✅ Cross-references to related words
**Evidence**:
- Synonyms: G3982 (πείθω), G5449 (φύσις), G4102 (πίστις)
- Antonyms: φαντασία (mere appearance)
- Hebrew equivalents: H985 (בִּטְחָה), H3690 (כִּסְלָה)
- Proximity scores from Clear-Bible data

**Status**: PASS ✅

---

### ✗ AVOID: Making 8-category semantic range for 5 occurrences
**Evidence**:
- Created only 2 categories (ontological, epistemological)
- Avoided unnecessary subdivision
- Each category grounded in actual biblical usage

**Status**: AVOIDED ✅

---

## Key Insights

### 1. Rarity ≠ Poor Web Coverage
**Finding**: Words with theological significance receive extensive lexical treatment regardless of frequency.

**Evidence**: ὑπόστασις (5x) has coverage equal to or exceeding δικαιοσύνη (92x).

**Implication**: Don't skip rare words—theologically important ones are extraction goldmines.

---

### 2. Theological Significance > Statistical Frequency
**Finding**: Lexicographers prioritize theological/philosophical importance over raw occurrence counts.

**Evidence**:
- ὑπόστασις used in Trinity formulation (Heb 1:3)
- ὑπόστασις defines faith (Heb 11:1)
- Philosophical significance (Aristotle, Stoics)
- Result: Disproportionate scholarly attention

**Implication**: Rare theological terms are HIGH-VALUE extraction targets.

---

### 3. Restraint is Achievable with Discipline
**Finding**: Can maintain honest analysis without fabrication if methodology emphasizes quality over quantity.

**Methodology**:
- Focus on lexical sources (HELPS, Thayer's, LSJ) rather than inventing usage patterns
- Leverage classical Greek to supplement sparse NT data
- Use confidence markers to acknowledge uncertainty
- Explicitly document limitations

**Implication**: Rare word extraction viable with disciplined approach.

---

### 4. Confidence Markers Essential for Rare Words
**Finding**: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW markers critical for managing uncertainty with limited data.

**Application**:
- HIGH: Well-attested meanings, clear biblical examples
- MEDIUM: Secondary sources, cross-language equivalents, debated interpretations
- LOW: Speculative connections, limited evidence (if any)

**Implication**: Confidence markers should be REQUIRED for all rare word (<10 occurrences) extractions.

---

### 5. Complete Occurrence Lists Valuable
**Finding**: Listing all 5 occurrences provides transparency and prevents over-generalization.

**Value**:
- Reader can verify claims against complete data
- Prevents fabricating usage patterns
- Enables other researchers to build on work
- Demonstrates honesty about data limitations

**Implication**: For words <20 occurrences, include complete occurrence list in usage_statistics section.

### 2. Mandatory Elements for Very Rare Words (<10 occurrences)
- ✅ Explicit rarity classification in usage_statistics
- ✅ Complete occurrence list
- ✅ Limit semantic categories (1-3 maximum)
- ✅ Confidence markers (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) throughout
- ✅ Acknowledge limitations explicitly
- ✅ Leverage classical Greek lexicons (LSJ) to supplement sparse NT data

### 3. Quality Over Quantity
- Emphasize rich lexical sources (HELPS, Thayer's, LSJ)
- Don't fabricate usage patterns from limited examples
- Cross-reference related words to provide context
- Highlight theological/philosophical significance
- Trace semantic development from classical to NT Greek

### 4. Confidence Marker Guidelines
- **HIGH**: Well-attested meanings, clear biblical examples, strong lexical consensus

### 6. Avoid Over-Analysis
- Don't create elaborate semantic taxonomies unsupported by data
- Limit to demonstrable categories from actual occurrences
- Resist temptation to invent nuanced subcategories
- Use "Note" fields to acknowledge what's uncertain

---

## Next Steps for Tool Development

### 1. Implement Rarity Tiers
Create automated classification:
- Hapax legomenon (1x)
- Very rare (2-9x)
- Rare (10-24x)
- Uncommon (25-49x)
- Common (50-99x)
- Very common (100+x)

### 2. Auto-Generate Occurrence Lists
For words <20 occurrences, automatically include complete list in `usage_statistics.complete_occurrence_list`

### 3. Confidence Marker Prompts
Prompt for confidence levels when:
- Word <10 occurrences
- Cross-language equivalents suggested
- Debated interpretations noted

### 4. LSJ Emphasis for Rare Words
When word <25 occurrences, emphasize LSJ extraction to leverage classical Greek usage for context

### 5. Validation Rules
- **Critical**: No fabrication, all claims cited, rarity acknowledged
- **High Priority**: Confidence markers used, semantic categories limited (1-3 for <10 occurrences)
- **Medium**: Complete occurrence list, classical Greek background
