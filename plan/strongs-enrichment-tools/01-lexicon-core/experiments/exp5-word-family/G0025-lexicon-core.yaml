    analysis: "SIGNIFICANT DIVERGENCE between traditional evangelical interpretation (strong distinction) and modern lexical scholarship (largely synonymous with contextual overlap). Traditional view emphasizes theological utility of distinguishing volitional from emotional love; modern view emphasizes lexical data showing interchangeable usage by NT authors and LXX translators. John's own interchangeable usage (Jhn.3:35/5:20) and LXX parallels (Gen.37:3-4) support synonymy; theological contexts (enemy-love, God-love) support distinction. Likely resolution: semantic overlap with contextual emphasis differences rather than rigid distinction {all-sources}"

    significance: "Critical for proper exegesis of Jhn.21:15-17 (Peter's restoration) and understanding of NT love theology. Over-emphasis on distinction can lead to eisegesis; ignoring contextual nuances can obscure theological emphases. Balance required: recognize substantial overlap while respecting contextual usage patterns"

  - semantic_area: "Etymology uncertainty"
    analysis: "Strong's proposes 'perhaps from ἄγαν (much)' but acknowledges uncertainty. StudyLight notes 'uncertainty in the etymology, with various scholars proposing different origins.' No consensus on precise etymological root {strongs} {studylight}"
    significance: "Etymology unclear, but semantic field well-established through usage. Demonstrates limitation of etymological arguments for determining NT meaning - synchronic usage more determinative than diachronic origin"

  - semantic_area: "Secular vs biblical usage"
    analysis: "Ancient secular Greek usage rare and meant 'to prefer'; LXX appropriated term for theological development; NT further specialized meaning. HELPS emphasizes 'purely Biblical and ecclesiastical' nature of developed theological sense {helps} {studylight}"
    significance: "Word underwent significant semantic development through LXX and NT usage, becoming specialized theological term distinct from limited classical usage"
