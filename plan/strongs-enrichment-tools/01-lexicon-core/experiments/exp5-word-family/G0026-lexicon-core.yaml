      note: "Clear verb → noun derivation; all sources agree"

  historical_development:
    rarity_in_classical_greek: "Thayer identifies as 'a purely Biblical and ecclesiastical word' - secular authors from Aristotle onward used ἀγάπησις instead {biblehub-thayer} {blb}"
    profane_usage: "Only three supposed instances in profane Greek, with two readings disputed and one doubtful {studylight}"
    lxx_usage: "Employed for Hebrew אַהֲבָה (ahavah); appears 14 times in LXX for sexual love initially {biblehub-thayer} {studylight}"
    semantic_elevation: "Underwent 'redemption' for elevated spiritual meaning in Alexandrian Jewish texts (Wisdom of Solomon, Aristeas) before NT appropriation {studylight}"

  pedagogical_note: "Foundational theological term requiring students to understand: (1) verb-noun derivation from G25, (2) distinction from φιλία (friendship), στοργή (natural affection), ἔρως (sexual love), (3) purely biblical/ecclesiastical development, (4) dual meaning (love as attribute AND love-feasts as practice) {thayer} {studylight-abbott-smith}"

lexical_convergence:
  primary_meaning: "Love - specifically theologically developed Christian love; divine love as God's nature and action; covenant love between God and humanity in Christ"
  lexicons_agreeing: ["strongs", "thayer", "helps", "mounce", "abbott-smith"]
  confidence: HIGH
  convergence_summary: "Universal agreement across all lexicons: ἀγάπη is distinctively Christian theological term (purely biblical and ecclesiastical) describing divine love, covenant love in Christ, and Christian mutual love - distinct from friendship (φιλία), natural affection (στοργή), and sexual love (ἔρως). All sources emphasize moral/spiritual preference rather than emotional feeling, and note rarity in secular Greek {strongs} {thayer} {helps} {mounce} {abbott-smith} {biblehub} {studylight}"

lexical_divergence:
  - semantic_area: "Secular rarity and semantic elevation"
    analysis: "Thayer calls it 'purely Biblical and ecclesiastical' - secular authors preferred ἀγάπησις; only three disputed instances in profane Greek {biblehub-thayer} {blb}. StudyLight documents semantic journey: LXX 14x for sexual love → Alexandrian Jewish texts elevate meaning (Wisdom, Aristeas) → NT exclusively spiritual/covenantal (116x, never sexual). Represents remarkable 'redemption' of term from rare/neutral to theologically central {studylight}"
    significance: "Demonstrates Christian appropriation and elevation of linguistic resources - rare classical term became foundational theological vocabulary through LXX and NT usage"

  - semantic_area: "Etymology: back-formation process"
    analysis: "StudyLight identifies as back-formation from restricted dialectic area in Koine, replacing older ἀγάπησις. Unusual linguistic development: older form (ἀγάπησις) abandoned in Christian usage for newer dialectic variant (ἀγάπη) {studylight}"
    significance: "Linguistic curiosity: Christians chose emerging dialectic form over established classical term, perhaps for theological distinctiveness"

  - semantic_area: "Love-feasts as distinct category"
    analysis: "Thayer and BLB document secondary meaning: plural ἀγαπαι = communal meals before Lord's Supper, economic sharing between wealthy and poor believers {biblehub-thayer} {blb}. Only appears this way in Jud.1:12, possibly 2Pe.2:13. Represents concrete expression of abstract love concept {biblehub}"
    significance: "Bridge between theological abstraction and liturgical/social practice - love as both doctrine and enacted community ritual"

  - semantic_area: "Relationship to synonym debate"
    analysis: "Abbott-Smith distinguishes ἀγάπη from φιλία (friendship), στοργή (natural affection), ἔρως (sexual love) - but this is noun-level distinction, not necessarily engaging verb-level ἀγαπάω/φιλέω debate {studylight-abbott-smith}. Noun form ἀγάπη clearly specialized for spiritual/covenantal love in all sources; verb form ἀγαπάω has more scholarly debate about overlap with φιλέω {see-G25-file}"
    significance: "Noun form less controversial than verb form regarding synonym distinctions - ἀγάπη clearly specialized, while ἀγαπάω/φιλέω debate continues"
