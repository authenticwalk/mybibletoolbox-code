      sources: "D.A. Carson, Andrew Das, Mounce, Abbott-Smith caution, modern lexical scholarship, John's interchangeable usage, LXX parallels {web-search} {studylight}"

    analysis: "SIGNIFICANT DIVERGENCE mirroring G25 findings. Base Strong's definition assumes traditional distinction ('chiefly of the heart' vs. 'chiefly of the head'), Thayer's articulates it fully, Trench's Synonyms formalizes it. Yet modern scholarship (Carson, Das, Mounce's qualification, Abbott-Smith's caution) questions whether distinction exists consistently in actual NT usage. Evidence cuts both ways: (1) FOR distinction: enemy-love commandability, some contextual emphases; (2) FOR synonymy: John's own interchangeable usage (Jhn.3:35/5:20), LXX parallels (Gen.37:3-4), Xenophon classical synonymy, Jhn.16:27 (φιλεῖ disciples) vs. Jhn.3:16 (ἀγαπάω world) tension, Greek Fathers' silence. Likely resolution: semantic overlap with contextual emphasis differences rather than rigid distinction; traditional distinction theologically useful but lexically overstated {all-sources}"

    significance: "Critical for proper exegesis - especially Jhn.21:15-17. Traditional view (Jesus tests Peter's commitment level) vs. modern view (stylistic variation without semantic distinction). Also affects understanding of Jhn.5:20 (Father φιλεῖ Son) and 16:27 (Father φιλεῖ disciples). Balance required: recognize substantial overlap while respecting contextual usage patterns"

  - semantic_area: "Classical breadth vs. NT narrowing"
    analysis: "LSJ documents extensive classical usage across 7+ major categories: affection, hospitality, sexual love contexts, kissing, approval of things, habitual action, impersonal usage. NT narrows to 4 primary contexts: divine/personal affection (Jhn.5:20, 11:3, 16:27), Peter's dialogue (Jhn.21:15-17), kissing (betrayal context Mat.26:48, Mrk.14:44, Luk.22:47), misplaced affections (Mat.23:6, Luk.20:46, Jhn.12:25, Rev.22:15). Classical hospitality and habitual action categories absent from NT {base-lsj} {biblehub}"
    significance: "NT usage more focused and theologically loaded than classical breadth. Semantic narrowing from general 'approval/affection' to specific theological applications"

  - semantic_area: "Frequency asymmetry with ἀγαπάω"
    analysis: "φιλέω: 25 NT occurrences vs. ἀγαπάω: 143 occurrences. Ratio nearly 6:1 in favor of ἀγαπάω. If truly synonymous, would expect more balanced usage; if truly distinct, asymmetry explained by NT emphasis on volitional covenant love over emotional friendship {blb}"
