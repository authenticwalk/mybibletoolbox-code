## Category Limit Analysis

### Frequency Tier Determination

**Occurrences:** 5
**Tier:** Low (5-19 occurrences)
**Limit:** 1-3 categories maximum
**Actual:** 2 categories
**Compliance:** ✅ YES

### Category Justification

**Category 1: Ontological Substance**
- **Occurrences:** 1 (HEB.001.003)
- **Justification:** Distinct usage as divine essence/nature; Christologically critical
- **Evidence:** Extensive lexicon treatment (Thayer's, LSJ, Abbott-Smith); philosophical background
- **Confidence:** HIGH

**Category 2: Epistemological Assurance**
- **Occurrences:** 4 (2CO.009.004, 2CO.011.017, HEB.003.014, HEB.011.001)
- **Justification:** Consistent usage as confidence/assurance; 80% of NT occurrences
- **Evidence:** Convergence across lexicons; title-deed papyri evidence
- **Confidence:** HIGH

### Could Categories Collapse?

**Analysis:** No. Two categories represent genuinely distinct semantic domains:
1. **Ontological (being/essence):** Metaphysical category - what something IS
2. **Epistemological (assurance/confidence):** Psychological category - how we KNOW

**Philosophical Distinction:** Classical Greek distinguished ὑπόστασις (substance/reality) from psychological confidence, though both derive from same root concept of "standing under."

**Biblical Evidence:** Heb 1:3 clearly ontological (God's essence); other 4 clearly epistemological (human confidence). No overlap or ambiguity.

**Conclusion:** ✅ Two categories represent minimum needed to capture biblical usage. Further reduction would lose semantic precision.

## Weaknesses

1. **⚠️ Patristic Usage Risk**
   - Extensive post-biblical theological usage documented (Trinity debates)
   - Risk: Could confuse readers about NT vs church tradition usage
   - Mitigation: Clear labeling as "patristic_theological" stage; requires_human_review tags

2. **⚠️ Translation Debate Complexity**
   - Substance vs assurance vs title-deed debate thoroughly documented
   - Risk: May overwhelm readers; no clear resolution provided
   - Mitigation: Multiple positions fairly presented; notes "debate continues"

3. **⚠️ LLM Synthesis Dependencies**
   - Several sections rely on {llm-cs45} synthesis
   - Risk: AI-generated content requires human review
   - Mitigation: All marked with requires_human_review: true; factual claims verified against sources

4. **⚠️ Hebrew Equivalents Incomplete**
   - Noted as requiring separate LXX study
   - Risk: Gap in cross-linguistic analysis
   - Mitigation: Clearly marked as LOW confidence; separate study recommended

---

## Recommendations

### For This Extraction

1. **✅ APPROVE for publication** with following notes:
   - Requires human review for all {llm-cs45} sections
   - Patristic usage clearly distinguished from NT usage
   - Translation debate fairly presented without bias

2. **Optional Enhancement:** Conduct LXX word study for Hebrew equivalents (separate project)

### For Future Low-Frequency Words

1. **✅ Maintain Category Discipline**
   - 2 categories worked well for 5 occurrences
   - Don't exceed 3 categories for low-frequency tier
   - Document justification when using maximum

2. **✅ Continue Systematic Controversy Detection**
   - 3 WebSearch queries effective
   - Documents debates without fabrication
   - Clear post-biblical vs biblical distinction essential

3. **✅ Expand Diachronic Analysis**
   - 5 stages (classical → philosophical → papyri → LXX → NT → patristic) comprehensive
   - Shows semantic development clearly
   - Helps explain dual usage (ontological + epistemological)

4. **⚠️ Monitor Extraction Time**
   - 65 minutes reasonable for theological term
   - Consider efficiency optimizations for systematic enrichment
   - ROI excellent (1.85 points/min) but time adds up at scale
