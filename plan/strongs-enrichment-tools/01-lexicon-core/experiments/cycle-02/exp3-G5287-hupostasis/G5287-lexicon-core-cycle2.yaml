# TRANSLATION CONSIDERATIONS
# ============================================================================

translation_challenges:
  - challenge: dual_semantic_range
    description: |
      "Single word encompasses both ontological (substance/essence) and epistemological
      (assurance/confidence) meanings with no ambiguity in Greek—context determines sense"
    resolution: |
      "Translators must choose English equivalent based on context: 'nature/being/essence'
      for Heb 1:3; 'assurance/confidence' for other four occurrences" {llm-cs45}
    examples:
      - reference: HEB.001.003
        sense: ontological
        recommended: "nature, being, essence"
        translations: "nature (NASB, ESV), being (NIV), person (KJV)"

      - reference: HEB.011.001
        sense: epistemological_with_debate
        recommended: "assurance (with possible 'substance' nuance)"
        translations: "assurance (NASB, ESV), confidence (NIV), substance (KJV)"
        note: "Translation debate ongoing; perhaps both objective and subjective dimensions"

      - reference: HEB.003.014
        sense: epistemological
        recommended: "assurance, confidence"
        translations: "assurance (NASB), conviction (NIV), confidence (ESV)"

      - reference: 2CO.009.004, 2CO.011.017
        sense: epistemological
        recommended: "confidence, boast"
        translations: "confident boasting (NASB), boast (NIV, ESV)"

  - challenge: philosophical_background
    description: |
      "Greek philosophical usage (Aristotelian 'substance,' metaphysical reality)
      influences NT usage, especially Hebrews" {lsj} {thayer}
    implication: |
      "Translators must balance philosophical precision with accessibility.
      'Substance' preserves philosophical depth but archaic in modern English;
      'assurance' more accessible but loses ontological dimension" {llm-cs45}
    recommendation: |
      "Study notes can explain philosophical background; translation should prioritize
      clarity for target audience while maintaining theological accuracy"

  - challenge: rarity_limits_certainty
    description: |
      "Only 5 occurrences limit ability to fully map semantic range with high confidence" {llm-cs45}
    implication: |
      "Some uncertainty remains about nuances, especially in 2 Cor passages.
      Translators must acknowledge limitations of available data"
    confidence: MEDIUM

  - challenge: title_deed_hypothesis
    description: |
      "Papyri evidence suggests possible 'title-deed' sense in Heb 11:1, but not
      universally accepted among scholars" {abbott-smith}
    debate: |
      "Should translators adopt 'title-deed' metaphor or stick with traditional
      'substance/assurance'? Title-deed captures both objective and subjective
      dimensions but unfamiliar to modern readers" {llm-cs45}
    current_approach: |
      "Most translations use 'assurance/confidence/reality'; 'title-deed' appears
      in study notes rather than main text"

    - NASB: "confident boasting" (9:4, 11:17)
    - KJV: "confidence of this boasting" (9:4, 11:17)
