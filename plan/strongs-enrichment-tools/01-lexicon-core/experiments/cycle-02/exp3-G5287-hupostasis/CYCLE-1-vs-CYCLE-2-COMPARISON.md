## Category Discipline Comparison

### Category Counts

| Metric | Cycle 1 | Cycle 2 | Change |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| **Categories Used** | 2 | 2 | Same ✅ |
| **Tier Limit** | Implied (1-3) | Explicit (1-3) | Better documentation |
| **Compliance Documented** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Improved |
| **Justification** | Implied | Explicit | Improved |

**Cycle 1 Categories:**
1. Ontological substance
2. Epistemological assurance

**Cycle 2 Categories:**

2. Epistemological assurance (same)

**Analysis:** Identical category count (appropriate for 5 occurrences). Cycle 2 adds explicit documentation of limit compliance and justification.

### Category Limit Enforcement

**Cycle 1:**
- Category limit implied but not explicitly documented
- Restraint shown but no formal compliance check
- Note: "Limited to 2 primary categories (vs. 8 for common words) due to only 5 occurrences"

**Cycle 2:**
- Category limit explicitly documented: "Low frequency (5-19 occurrences) = 1-3 categories maximum"
- Formal compliance check: "2 categories (within 1-3 limit) ✅ COMPLIANT"
- Validation section includes category_limit_compliant: true

**Impact:** Cycle 2 makes category discipline systematic and verifiable, not just implied.

**Cycle 2:**
1. **Terminological Confusion:** Ousia vs hypostasis in early church (4th century)
2. **Theological Debate:** Monohypostatic vs trihypostatic theology
3. **Translation Debate:** Hebrews 11:1 substance vs assurance vs title-deed (comprehensive)
4. **Christological Debate:** Hypostatic idioms of the flesh (5th-8th centuries)

**Search Queries Performed:**
1. "hypostasis false etymology Greek word"
2. "hypostasis ὑπόστασις controversy scholarly debate"
3. "Hebrews 11:1 hypostasis substance assurance translation debate"

**Impact:** Systematic controversy detection successful. Much more thorough and well-sourced.

  - NIV: "confidence" (2 Cor), "exact representation of his being" (Heb 1:3), "confidence" (Heb 11:1)
  - NASB: "confidence" (2 Cor, Heb 3:14), "exact representation of His nature" (Heb 1:3), "assurance" (Heb 11:1)
  note: "Trend toward 'assurance/confidence' for epistemological usage; 'nature/being' for ontological"
```

**Cycle 2 Example:**
```yaml
modern_translation_trends:
  ontological_usage_heb_1_3:
    - ESV: "exact imprint of his nature"
    - NIV: "exact representation of his being"
    - NASB: "exact representation of His nature"
    - NLT: "exact representation of God's very character"
    - KJV: "express image of his person"
    trend: "Shift from 'person' (KJV) to 'nature/being' (modern); clearer ontological emphasis"

  epistemological_usage_heb_11_1:
    - ESV: "assurance of things hoped for"
    - NIV: "confidence in what we hope for"
    - NASB: "assurance of things hoped for"
    - NLT: "confidence in what we hope for, assuring us of things we cannot see"
    - KJV: "substance of things hoped for"
    trend: |
      "Shift from 'substance' (KJV, ontological) to 'assurance/confidence' (modern, epistemological).
      Reflects preference for subjective certainty over objective reality, though debate continues"
```

**Impact:** Cycle 2 translation analysis much more systematic and detailed. Organized by semantic category with trend analysis.
