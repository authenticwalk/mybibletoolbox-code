# ETYMOLOGY & MORPHOLOGICAL ROOT
etymology:
  root: "G846 αὐτός (itself the primary root)"
  possible_derivation: "from particle αὖ, perhaps akin to the base of G109 ἀήρ through the idea of a baffling wind (backward) {strongs} {blb}"
  etymological_note: |
    "Connection to atmospheric/wind concepts uncertain but suggested through particle αὖ {strongs} {blb}.
    In oblique cases αὐτός coalesced with personal pronouns later creating compound reflexives
    ἐμαυτοῦ, σεαυτοῦ, ἑαυτοῦ {lsj} {studylight}."
  convergence: |
    "All lexicons agree: primary third-person pronoun with reflexive capacity,
    standard three-gender declension (masculine/feminine/neuter) {strongs} {thayer} {lsj} {abbott-smith}"

# PEDAGOGICAL INSIGHTS
pedagogical_insights:
  learning_challenges:
    - challenge: "Position ambiguity requires recognition of article placement patterns {studylight}"
      resolution: "Distinguish functional usage through article presence and position relative to nouns {studylight}"

    - challenge: "Multiple overlapping functions can cause confusion (reflexive vs. personal vs. intensive) {studylight}"
      resolution: "Oblique case forms are essential context clues; nominative forms signal intensive/reflexive usage {studylight} {biblehub}"

    - challenge: "Distinguishing intensified/reflexive usage from standard third-person pronoun function {mounce}"
      resolution: "Check case (nominative = likely intensive; oblique = likely personal pronoun) and article presence (ὁ αὐτός = 'the same') {mounce} {abbott-smith}"

  mounce_emphasis: |
    "Intensified pronoun usage alongside personal pronoun functions, requiring students to
    distinguish reflexive versus standard third-person applications {mounce}"

  common_parsing_difficulties:
    - "Nominative singular rarely appears as simple pronoun (contrary to student expectations from English) {biblehub}"
    - "Gender/number agreement crucial for accurate parsing due to three-gender declension {studylight}"
    - "Form overlap between nominative and accusative neuter (αὐτό, αὐτά) requires syntactic analysis {llm-cs45}"

# DIACHRONIC FREQUENCY ANALYSIS
diachronic_analysis:
  classical:
    frequency: "Rare in Epic dialect, mostly emphatic usage {lsj}"
    dialects: "Epic/Attic/Ionic variations; contracted forms ταὐτό, ταὐτόν in Attic {lsj}"
    usage_note: "In Prose either precedes both article and substantive, or follows both (αὐτὸς ὁ υἱός or ὁ υἱὸς αὐτός) {lsj} {studylight}"
    article_construction: "αὐτός for ὁ αὐτός ('the same') never in Tragedy but appears in later Prose {lsj} {studylight}"

  koine:
    frequency: "Much more frequently used in late Greek (Koine) than classical, particularly in oblique cases for simple third person reference {lsj} {abbott-smith}"
    shift_explanation: |
      "Increased functional load in Koine period: expanded from primarily emphatic/reflexive usage (Classical)
      to dominant simple third-person pronoun in oblique cases (Koine). Nominative usage 'contrary to Greek usage'
      where classical would employ δέ or οὗτος {biblehub} {lsj}."
    register: "Narrative prominence in Gospels and Acts; theological constructions in Pauline epistles; exalted Christology in Revelation {biblehub}"
    genre_distribution: "Matthew leads with highest frequency, reflecting Koine narrative patterns {studylight}"

  frequency_trajectory: |
    "Clear diachronic trajectory from Classical to Koine: (1) Epic - rare, emphatic only;
    (2) Classical Prose - increased anaphoric usage; (3) Later Prose - ὁ αὐτός → αὐτός simplification begins;
    (4) Koine - dominant third-person pronoun in all oblique cases, expanded functional range {lsj} {abbott-smith} {llm-cs45}"
