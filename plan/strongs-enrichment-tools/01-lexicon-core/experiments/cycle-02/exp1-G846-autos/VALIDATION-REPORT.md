## Areas for Potential Enhancement (Optional)

1. **Extended Form Distribution:**
   - Could extract all 49 forms (currently top 15)
   - Benefit: Complete paradigm documentation
   - Trade-off: Diminishing returns for ultra-low frequency forms

2. **Thematic Verse Analysis:**
   - Could analyze specific verse contexts for each functional category
   - Benefit: Richer examples
   - Trade-off: Moves toward semantic analysis (not grammatical pathway focus)

3. **Comparative Pronoun Analysis:**
   - Could compare to οὗτος (G3778), δέ (G1161) usage patterns
   - Benefit: Contrastive grammatical analysis
   - Trade-off: Scope expansion beyond single-word extraction

**Note:** These are optional enhancements. Current extraction already exceeds validation requirements.
