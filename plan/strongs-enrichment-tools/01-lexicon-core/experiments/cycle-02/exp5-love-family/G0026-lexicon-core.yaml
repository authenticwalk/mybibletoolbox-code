# Etymology & Root Analysis
etymology:
  root_words:
    - strongs: G0025
      lemma: ἀγαπάω
      relationship: "noun derived from verb G25 ἀγαπάω (to love)"
      source: "{strongs} {biblehub} {studylight} {blb}"
      confidence: "HIGH"
      note: "Clear verb → noun derivation; all sources agree"

  back_formation:
    claim: "ἀγάπη is a back-formation from the verb, replacing the older ἀγάπησις"
    source: "{studylight-abbott-smith} {web-search-moulton-milligan}"
    scholarly_quote: |
      "Ἀγάπη is in any case a back-formation from the verb, replacing the older
      ἀγάπησις, and originating doubtless in a restricted dialectic area." (Moulton & Milligan, 1930) {web-search}

    linguistic_process: |
      Classical authors (Aristotle, etc.) preferred ἀγάπησις as the noun form. In Koine
      period, dialectic variant ἀγάπη emerged and gradually replaced ἀγάπησις,
      especially in Jewish Hellenistic Greek (LXX). {studylight-abbott-smith} {web-search}

  convergence_note: |
    All lexicons agree: ἀγάπη derives from G25 ἀγαπάω and represents back-formation
    replacing older ἀγάπησις. First prominent usage in LXX (Song of Solomon). {strongs} {biblehub} {studylight}

  root_etymology_uncertainty: |
    While derivation from G25 is certain, the ultimate etymology of the agap- root remains
    uncertain. Proposed: from ἄγαν ('much'), PIE *aga-pa- ('to protect greatly'), or
    unknown origin. {web-search} See G25 file for detailed etymology discussion.

    source: "{biblehub-thayer} {studylight-abbott-smith} {web-search}"

      view: "Ἀγάπη is a purely Biblical and ecclesiastical word, rare or absent in secular Greek"
      proponents:

          source: "{studylight-thayer}"

        - point: "First prominent usage in LXX (Song of Solomon 2:4,5,7; 3:5,10; 5:8; 7:6; 8:4,6,7)"
          source: "{biblehub-thayer}"

        - point: "NT uses term 116 times vs. extreme rarity in classical texts"
          source: "{blb}"

    modern_position:
      view: "Ἀγάπη was emerging in classical Greek from 4th century BCE onward, not exclusively biblical"
      proponents:
        - "Robert Joly (scholarly research) {web-search}"
        - "Contemporary classical lexicography"
      source: "{web-search}"

      evidence:
        - point: "Joly presented convincing evidence that ἀγαπάω was coming into prominence throughout Greek literature from 4th century B.C. on"
          source: "{web-search}"
          note: "Not restricted to biblical literature"

        - point: "LXX translators (3rd-2nd cent. BCE) chose existing Greek term, not invented one"
          implication: "Term must have had semantic flexibility for theological appropriation"

        - point: "Alexandrian Jewish texts (Wisdom of Solomon, Aristeas) show semantic elevation before NT"
          source: "{studylight-abbott-smith}"
          note: "Demonstrates pre-Christian theological development"

    scholarly_consensus:
      synthesis: |
        Ἀγάπη was indeed rare in classical Greek (secular authors preferred ἀγάπησις),
        but not completely absent. LXX translators appropriated and elevated an emerging
        dialectic variant. NT usage represents culmination of semantic development
        begun in Hellenistic Judaism. {llm-cs45}

      significance: |
        Demonstrates Christian linguistic appropriation: taking rare/emerging Greek term,
        infusing with Hebrew covenant love concepts (אַהֲבָה), elevating semantically
        through theological usage. {llm-cs45}

  - type: "semantic_elevation"
    claim: "Ἀγάπη underwent dramatic semantic transformation from sexual to spiritual usage"
    source: "{biblehub-thayer} {studylight-abbott-smith}"

    historical_trajectory:
      - period: "LXX (250 BCE - 100 BCE)"
        usage: "14 times for sexual love, including Song of Solomon; twice in antithesis to hatred"
        source: "{studylight-abbott-smith}"
        note: "Initial usage includes physical/romantic love"

      - period: "Alexandrian Jewish texts (1st cent. BCE)"
        usage: "Wisdom of Solomon and Aristeas (§229) demonstrate elevated spiritual usage"
        source: "{studylight-abbott-smith}"
        note: "Alexandrian Jews led the way in semantic elevation"

      - period: "NT (50 CE - 100 CE)"
        usage: "116 times, exclusively for spiritual/covenantal love, never sexual"
        source: "{blb} {biblehub}"
        note: "Complete semantic specialization"

    semantic_redemption:
      process: |
        Abbott-Smith calls this semantic elevation a "redemption" of the term. What began
        as rare classical term, used in LXX for sexual love, was elevated by Alexandrian
        Jewish theologians, then fully specialized by NT writers for divine/covenant love. {studylight-abbott-smith}

      significance: |
        Demonstrates theological language development: LXX appropriation → Hellenistic
        Jewish elevation → NT specialization. Word "redeemed" from broader usage for
        narrower theological precision. {llm-cs45}

  - type: "back_formation_linguistics"
    claim: "Ἀγάπη represents back-formation replacing older ἀγάπησις"
    source: "{studylight-abbott-smith} {web-search-moulton-milligan}"

    linguistic_explanation:
      process: |
        Classical authors preferred ἀγάπησις (Aristotle, etc.). In Koine period, dialectic
        variant ἀγάπη emerged from restricted dialectic area, gradually replacing ἀγάπησις,
        especially in Jewish Hellenistic Greek. {studylight-abbott-smith} {web-search}

      scholarly_consensus: |
        Moulton & Milligan (1930): "Ἀγάπη is in any case a back-formation from the verb,
        replacing the older ἀγάπησις, and originating doubtless in a restricted dialectic area." {web-search}

    significance: |
      Unusual linguistic development: newer dialectic form displaced established classical
      term. LXX translators chose emerging variant over standard classical noun, perhaps
      for theological distinctiveness or dialectic preference. {llm-cs45}

  - type: "relationship_to_synonym_debate"
    claim: "Noun form ἀγάπη less controversial than verb form ἀγαπάω regarding synonym distinctions"
    source: "{llm-cs45} (analysis based on lexical data)"

    noun_specialization:
      observation: |
        All lexicons agree ἀγάπη is clearly specialized for spiritual/covenantal love
        in NT usage (116 instances, never sexual, always theological). {biblehub} {studylight}

      contrast_with_verb: |
        Verb ἀγαπάω has broader usage including worldly preferences (loving darkness
        JHN.003.019, worldly things 2TI.004.010), leading to more scholarly debate about
        whether it's distinct from φιλέω. See G25 file for detailed controversy. {llm-cs45}

    consensus: |
      Noun form ἀγάπη achieved nearly complete semantic specialization in NT, while verb
      form ἀγαπάω retained broader semantic range, making noun-level distinction clearer
      than verb-level. {llm-cs45}

# Diachronic Development
diachronic_analysis:
  classical:
    period: "Pre-LXX classical Greek"
    usage: "Extremely rare; secular authors preferred ἀγάπησις as noun form"
    source: "{biblehub-thayer} {studylight-abbott-smith}"
    note: "Only 3 disputed instances in profane Greek {studylight-thayer}"

  lxx:
    period: "LXX translation (250 BCE - 100 BCE)"
    occurrences: 15
    source: "{blb}"

    usage: |
      Employed for Hebrew אַהֲבָה (ahavah); appears 14 times in LXX for sexual love
      initially (Song of Solomon prominent), twice in antithesis to hatred. {biblehub-thayer} {studylight-abbott-smith}

    hebrew_equivalent: "H0160 אַהֲבָה (ahavah) - love"

    significance: |
      LXX translators chose emerging dialectic variant ἀγάπη over established ἀγάπησις,
      beginning process of semantic appropriation for Hebrew covenant concepts. {llm-cs45}

  alexandrian_jewish:
    period: "Hellenistic Judaism (1st cent. BCE)"
    texts: "Wisdom of Solomon, Aristeas (§229)"
    source: "{studylight-abbott-smith}"

    semantic_elevation: |
      Alexandrian Jews "seem to have led the way" in repurposing term from successor
      to ἔρως toward elevated spiritual significance. Underwent "redemption" for
      elevated spiritual meaning before NT appropriation. {studylight-abbott-smith}

    significance: |
      Critical transition period: semantic elevation from physical/sexual usage (LXX Song of Solomon)
      toward spiritual/theological usage (preparation for NT specialization). {llm-cs45}

  nt_koine:
    period: "NT writings (50 CE - 100 CE)"
    occurrences: 116
    source: "{blb}"

    distribution: |
      Appears in 26 NT books; frequent in Paul, John's epistles, Peter, Jude; never in
      Acts, Mark, James; only once in Matthew and Luke; twice in Hebrews and Revelation.
      Highly concentrated in theological/epistolary literature. {biblehub}

    specialization: |
      Exclusively for spiritual/covenantal love (116x, never sexual, always theological).
      Became foundational theological vocabulary describing: (1) God's essential nature,
      (2) divine love toward humanity, (3) Christian mutual love, (4) law fulfillment,
      (5) eschatological virtue. {biblehub} {studylight}

    theological_development: |
      Complete semantic specialization: rare classical term → LXX sexual/covenant usage →
      Alexandrian elevation → NT exclusive spiritual usage. Represents culmination of
      multi-century semantic development. {llm-cs45}

      evidence: "Abbott-Smith documents full development {studylight-abbott-smith}"
      importance: "Shows theological language development over centuries"

    - point: "'Purely biblical' claim requires nuance"
      traditional: "Thayer: 'purely Biblical and ecclesiastical word'"
      modern: "Joly: evidence of classical usage from 4th cent. BCE"
      synthesis: "Rare in classical, appropriated and elevated by LXX/Judaism, specialized by NT"

    - point: "Dual meaning: abstract + concrete"
      abstract: "Love as theological concept (115+ instances)"
      concrete: "Love-feasts as liturgical practice (1-2 instances)"
      importance: "Demonstrates theology-practice integration"

    - point: "Noun form less controversial than verb"
      noun: "ἀγάπη clearly specialized for spiritual/covenantal love (all 116 instances)"
      verb: "ἀγαπάω has broader usage including worldly preferences (see G25)"
      implication: "Noun achieved complete semantic specialization"

  historical_development_lessons:
    - lesson: "Linguistic appropriation by faith communities"
      process: |
        LXX translators chose emerging dialectic variant over classical standard,
        infused with Hebrew concepts, elevated semantically through usage. NT writers
        completed specialization. {llm-cs45}

    - lesson: "Semantic elevation through theological use"
      example: |
        Term "redeemed" from broader classical usage (rare), through LXX sexual usage,
        via Alexandrian elevation, to NT exclusive spiritual usage. Demonstrates
        theological usage can transform word meanings. {studylight-abbott-smith}

    - lesson: "Conspicuous avoidance of ἔρως"
      observation: |
        NT writers deliberately chose ἀγάπη for divine/covenant love, avoiding ἔρως
        (sexual love) despite its prominence in classical Greek. {studylight-abbott-smith} {helps}
      significance: "Intentional semantic differentiation from pagan love concepts"
