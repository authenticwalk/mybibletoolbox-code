        sinful affections. Parallels ἀγαπάω negative usage (loving darkness JHN.003.019). {llm-cs45}

# HELPS Word-Studies
helps_word_study:
  definition: |
    To show warm affection in intimate friendship, characterized by tender, heartfelt
    consideration and kinship. {helps} {biblehub}

  emphasis: |
    Emotional and sentimental; personal attachment as matter of feeling rather than
    deliberate will. {helps} {biblehub}

  key_distinction: |
    Phileó emphasizes feelings, conditional, sentimental responses (the head), while
    agapaó (G25) centers on wholehearted, unconditional, devoted affection (the heart). {helps} {biblehub}

  note: |
    HELPS makes strong distinction between phileó and agapaó, representing traditional
    view. This distinction is contested in modern scholarship (see controversies section). {helps}

# SYSTEMATIC CONTROVERSY DETECTION (Cycle 2 refinement)
controversies:
  - type: "semantic_debate"
    claim: "The distinction between φιλέω (G5368) and ἀγαπάω (G25) is hotly contested"
    scope: "Entire NT usage, especially John 21:15-17"
    source: "{web-search-psephizo} {web-search-hermeneutics-se} {web-search-carson}"
    note: "Same controversy as documented in G25 file, viewed from φιλέω perspective"

    traditional_position:
      view: "Φιλέω signifies lower, human, friendship, emotional love; ἀγαπάω signifies higher, divine, volitional love"
      proponents:
        - "R.C. Trench (Synonyms of the New Testament, Section xii) {trench} {blb}"
        - "HELPS Word-studies (sentimental vs. wholehearted) {helps}"
        - "Thayer's Lexicon (emotion/sentiment vs. will/duty) {biblehub}"
      source: "{trench} {helps} {biblehub}"

      evidence:
        - point: "Thayer distinguishes: φιλέω = emotion/sentiment vs. ἀγαπάω = deliberate will/duty"
          quote: |
            Φιλέω "denotes personal attachment, as a matter of sentiment or feeling" while
            ἀγαπάω represents "judgment and deliberate assent of the will as a matter of
            principle, duty and propriety." {biblehub-thayer}

        - point: "Analogy: φιλέω relates to emotion like thumos (heart) relates to nous (mind)"
          source: "{biblehub-thayer}"
          note: "Emotion vs. intellect dichotomy"

        - point: "Christ commands ἀγαπάω toward enemies (MAT.005.044) not φιλέω"
          explanation: |
            Because emotional affection (φιλέω) cannot be commanded, only deliberate choice
            (ἀγαπάω) can. {blb}

        - point: "Trench's Latin distinction: φιλέω = amare (spontaneous) vs. ἀγαπάω = diligere (esteem-based)"
          source: "{trench}"

    modern_position:
      view: "Φιλέω and ἀγαπάω are essentially synonymous in most NT contexts; distinction is stylistic variation"
      proponents:
        - "D.A. Carson (Exegetical Fallacies) {web-search-carson}"
        - "Andrew Das {web-search}"
        - "Kostenberger, Blomberg, Morris, Bock {web-search}"
      source: "{web-search-churchleaders} {web-search-psephizo}"

      evidence:
        - point: "John uses both verbs interchangeably elsewhere in Gospel"
          examples:
            - "Father loves Son: ἀγαπάω (JHN.003.035), φιλέω (JHN.005.020)"
            - "Disciple Jesus loved: ἀγαπάω (JHN.013.023; 019.026; 021.007,020), φιλέω (JHN.020.002)"
          source: "{web-search-psephizo}"
          note: "Same relationship described with both verbs"

        - point: "Both words used for imperfect/worldly loves"
          examples:
            - "Ἀγαπάω: loved darkness (JHN.003.019), loved praise of men (JHN.012.043)"
            - "Φιλέω: loved best places (MAT.023.006), loved greetings (LUK.020.046)"
          source: "{biblehub}"
          note: "Neither verb is exclusively 'pure/divine' love"

        - point: "Aramaic substrate argument"
          explanation: |
            If Jesus-Peter conversation occurred in Aramaic (likely), there would be no
            distinction expressed because both Aramaic and Hebrew have only one basic word
            for love. Greek distinction may be translator's stylistic variation. {web-search-hermeneutics-se}

        - point: "Peter's grief due to 'third time' not word change"
          text: "Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time" (JHN.021.017)
          source: "{web-search-psephizo}"
          note: "John explicitly states reason for grief - repetition, not vocabulary"

        - point: "D.A. Carson on substantial overlap"
          quote: |
            "Although it is doubtless true that the entire range of αγαπάω and the entire
            range of φιλέω are not exactly the same, nevertheless they enjoy substantial overlap." {web-search-carson}
          implication: "Acknowledges some distinction but emphasizes contextual synonymy"

    scholarly_consensus:
      current_trend: |
        Contemporary biblical scholarship (post-1970s) tends to favor the synonymous
        interpretation. Many evangelical scholars now question the sharp distinction that
        was standard in 20th century expository preaching. {web-search-churchleaders} {web-search-psephizo}

      shift_explanation: |
        Represents move away from "etymological fallacy" and "illegitimate totality transfer"
        toward contextual usage. Recognition that John uses synonym pairs for stylistic
        variation throughout Gospel. {web-search-carson}

    translation_impact: |
      Most modern English translations do not attempt to distinguish the two Greek words
      in John 21, translating both as "love." NIV, ESV, NASB, NLT all use "love" for both
      φιλέω and ἀγαπάω. {llm-cs45}

# Diachronic Development
diachronic_analysis:
  classical:
    period: "Homer → Classical (800 BCE - 300 BCE)"
    usage: |
      Very broad semantic range: affection between persons, hospitality, romantic love,
      kissing, approval of things, impersonal subjects, habitual actions. {studylight-lsj}

    primary_sources: "Homer (Odyssey), Herodotus, Plato, Sophocles {studylight-lsj}"
    note: "Classical breadth (7+ categories) contrasts with NT narrowing (3 categories)"

  lxx:
    period: "LXX translation (250 BCE - 100 BCE)"
    occurrences: 27
    source: "{blb}"

    usage: |
      Primarily for personal affection and covenant relationships. Some narrowing from
      classical breadth, but broader than NT usage. {llm-cs45}

    note: "Transitional stage between classical breadth and NT specificity"

  nt_koine:
    period: "NT writings (50 CE - 100 CE)"
    occurrences: 25
    source: "{blb}"

    distribution: |
      Concentrated in Johannine literature (John 13 instances). Also in Synoptics (betrayal
      kisses), Paul (Titus, 1 Corinthians), Revelation. {biblehub}

    specialization: |
      Significant semantic narrowing from classical 7+ categories to 3 main contexts:
      (1) personal affection/friendship (17x), (2) physical kiss (3x), (3) worldly
      affections/negative (5x). {llm-cs45}

    theological_development: |
      Lost classical breadth (hospitality, romantic love, impersonal, habitual). Retained
      core meaning of personal affection but narrowed to specific relational contexts
      (divine-human, human-human, betrayal, misplaced). {llm-cs45}

    semantic_trajectory: |
      Classical broad usage (7+ categories) → LXX transitional (narrowing) → NT specific
      usage (3 categories). Demonstrates lexical specialization in biblical Greek. {llm-cs45}

      trajectory: "Classical 7+ categories → LXX transitional → NT 3 categories"
      evidence: "LSJ documents classical breadth {studylight-lsj}"
      importance: "Shows lexical specialization in biblical Greek"

    - point: "Φιλέω NOT always 'pure friendship love'"
      evidence: |
        Used for worldly affections (loving best places MAT.023.006, loving greetings
        LUK.020.046, loving lies REV.022.015) {biblehub}
      importance: "Corrects popular misconception; parallels ἀγαπάω negative usage"

    - point: "Φιλέω/ἀγαπάω distinction is contested"
      traditional: "Trench, Thayer, HELPS make strong distinction"
      modern: "Carson, Das, Kostenberger view as substantially synonymous"
      importance: "Teaches students to navigate scholarly debates; avoid oversimplification"

    - point: "Both verbs used for same relationships in John"
      evidence: |
        Father-Son love: both verbs. Jesus-beloved disciple love: both verbs. Worldly
        loves: both verbs. {web-search-psephizo}
      implication: "John's stylistic variation, not semantic precision"

  translation_implications:
    - issue: "Should translators distinguish φιλέω and ἀγαπάω in John 21?"
      traditional_practice: "Some older translations/interpretations attempted distinction"
      modern_practice: "NIV, ESV, NASB, NLT use 'love' for both {llm-cs45}"
      recommendation: |
        Most modern translations recognize stylistic variation. Footnotes may note Greek
        word difference without claiming semantic distinction. Avoid reading theological
        significance into word choice alone.

  exegetical_fallacies_to_avoid:
    - fallacy: "Illegitimate totality transfer"
      description: "Importing all possible meanings into every occurrence"
      example: "Reading 'pure emotional friendship' into every φιλέω instance"
      correction: |
        Context determines which semantic range applies. Φιλέω in MAT.023.006 (loving
        best places) ≠ JHN.005.020 (Father loving Son). {llm-cs45}

    - fallacy: "Simplistic synonym distinction"
      description: "Assuming φιλέω and ἀγαπάω are always semantically distinct"
      example: "John 21:15-17 distinction as exegetically determinative"
      correction: |
        Recognize John's stylistic variation; note both words used interchangeably
        elsewhere in Gospel; consider Aramaic substrate; focus on Peter's grief at
        repetition not vocabulary. {web-search-carson} {web-search-psephizo}

    - fallacy: "Etymology determines meaning"
      description: "Assuming φιλέω always means 'to be a friend' from φίλος"
      example: "Claiming Judas' kiss shows 'false friendship'"
      correction: |
        While etymology is φίλος (friend), synchronic usage shows φιλέω had broader
        meaning (kiss, affection, approval). Context determines specific sense. {llm-cs45}

  command_impossibility_argument:
    traditional_claim: |
      Christ commands ἀγαπάω toward enemies (MAT.005.044) not φιλέω because emotional
      affection cannot be commanded, only volitional choice can. {blb}

    critique: |
      This argument assumes the distinction it tries to prove. If φιλέω and ἀγαπάω
      overlap substantially (Carson's view), then word choice may reflect common NT
      usage patterns for enemy-love contexts, not semantic necessity. {llm-cs45}

    significance: |
      Demonstrates circular reasoning in traditional argumentation. Need to establish
      distinction from usage patterns before using it to explain word selection. {llm-cs45}
