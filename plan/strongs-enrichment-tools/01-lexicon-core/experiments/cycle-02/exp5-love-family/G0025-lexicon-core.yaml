    consensus: |
      Etymology remains uncertain despite multiple theories. All major lexicons cite
      "perhaps from agan" but acknowledge uncertainty. Synchronic usage in LXX and NT
      more determinative than diachronic origin. {biblehub} {strongs} {studylight}

# HELPS Word-Studies
helps_word_study:
  definition: |
    Properly, to prefer, to love; for the believer, preferring to 'live through Christ'
    (Gal 2:20); wholehearted, unconditional, devoted affection centered in choice. {helps} {biblehub}

  emphasis: |
    Discriminating affection which involves choice and selection. {helps}

  key_distinction: |
    Agapaó centers on wholehearted, unconditional, devoted affection (the heart),
    while phileo (G5368) emphasizes feelings, conditional, sentimental responses
    (the head). {helps} {biblehub}

  note: |
    HELPS makes strong distinction between agapaó and phileo, representing traditional
    view. This distinction is contested in modern scholarship (see controversies section). {helps}

# SYSTEMATIC CONTROVERSY DETECTION (Cycle 2 refinement)
controversies:
  - type: "semantic_debate"
    claim: "The distinction between ἀγαπάω (G25) and φιλέω (G5368) is hotly contested in modern scholarship"
    scope: "Particularly in John 21:15-17"
    source: "{web-search-psephizo} {web-search-hermeneutics-se}"

    traditional_position:
      view: "Agapaō signifies higher, divine, selfless, altruistic love; phileo signifies lower, human, friendship love"
      proponents:
        - "R.C. Trench (Synonyms of the New Testament, Section xii) {trench} {blb}"
        - "HELPS Word-studies (wholehearted vs. sentimental) {helps}"
        - "Traditional expositors and preachers"
      source: "{web-search} {trench}"

      evidence:
        - point: "Peter unwilling to claim agapaō after denying Christ"
          passage: "JHN.021.015-017"
          note: "Peter uses phileo when Jesus asks agapaō"

        - point: "Jesus' progressive questioning tests Peter's commitment level"
          passage: "JHN.021.017"
          note: "Jesus 'descends' to Peter's phileo in third question"

        - point: "HELPS distinguishes wholehearted (agape) vs. sentimental (phileo)"
          source: "{helps}"

    modern_position:
      view: "Agapaō and phileo are essentially synonymous in John 21 and most NT contexts; distinction is stylistic variation"
      proponents:
        - "D.A. Carson (Exegetical Fallacies) {web-search-carson}"
        - "Andrew Das {web-search}"
        - "Kostenberger, Blomberg, Morris, Bock {web-search}"
      source: "{web-search-churchleaders} {web-search-psephizo}"

      evidence:
        - point: "John uses both verbs interchangeably elsewhere in Gospel"
          examples:
            - "Father loves Son: agapaō (JHN.003.035), phileo (JHN.005.020)"
            - "Disciple Jesus loved: agapaō (JHN.013.023; 019.026; 021.007,020), phileo (JHN.020.002)"
          source: "{web-search-psephizo}"

        - point: "Both words used for imperfect/worldly loves"
          examples:
            - "Agapaō: loved darkness (JHN.003.019), loved praise of men (JHN.012.043)"
            - "Phileo: Pharisees love standing in synagogues"
          source: "{web-search}"
          note: "Demonstrates agapaō is NOT always 'divine unconditional love'"

        - point: "Aramaic factor - only one word for love"
          explanation: |
            If conversation occurred in Aramaic or Hebrew (likely), there would be
            no distinction expressed because both languages have only one basic word for love. {web-search-psephizo}
          source: "{web-search-hermeneutics-se}"

        - point: "Peter was grieved because Jesus asked 'a third time' not because of word change"
          passage: "JHN.021.017"
          text: "Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time"
          source: "{web-search-psephizo}"
          note: "John explicitly states reason for Peter's grief"

        - point: "D.A. Carson on semantic overlap"
          quote: |
            Although it is doubtless true that the entire range of αγαπάω and the entire
            range of φιλέω are not exactly the same, nevertheless they enjoy substantial overlap. {web-search-carson}
          note: "Acknowledges some distinction but emphasizes contextual synonymy"

        - point: "Post-Victorian scholarship consensus"
          statement: |
            Post-Victorian analysts (with exceptions) do not accept the difference between
            agapao and phileo here, because John uses interchangeable pairs of words regularly,
            and philein/agapan was already one of those pairs. {web-search-psephizo}

    scholarly_consensus:
      current_trend: "Contemporary biblical scholarship tends to favor the synonymous interpretation"
      source: "{web-search-churchleaders} {web-search-psephizo}"
      note: |
        Represents significant shift from traditional/popular teaching. Many evangelical
        scholars (Carson, Das, Kostenberger) now question the distinction that was once
        standard in expository preaching. {web-search}

    translation_impact: |
      Most modern English translations do not attempt to distinguish the two Greek words
      in John 21, translating both as "love." NIV, ESV, NASB, NLT all use "love" for both verbs. {llm-cs45}

    significance: |
      This controversy demonstrates the importance of contextual usage over etymological
      fallacies. The "agape = divine love" equation, while popular, is not supported by
      full NT usage (e.g., agapaō used for loving darkness, worldly things). Modern scholarship
      emphasizes John's stylistic variation rather than semantic precision in synonym pairs. {web-search}

  - type: "etymology_uncertainty"
    claim: "Etymology of ἀγαπάω is uncertain despite multiple theories"
    source: "{biblehub} {strongs} {studylight} {web-search-wiktionary}"

    proposed_origins:
      - "ἄγαν (agan, 'much') - most commonly cited but questionable {biblehub} {strongs}"
      - "Hebrew אָהַב - semantic parallel, not derivation {biblehub}"
      - "PIE *m̥ǵh₂-peh₂- (Pinault 1991) - scholarly proposal, not consensus {web-search-wiktionary}"
      - "Abkhaz loanword (Cornelius) - speculative {web-search-wiktionary}"

    consensus: |
      All major lexicons acknowledge uncertainty ("perhaps from agan"). Synchronic
      usage (LXX rendering Hebrew אָהַב, NT theological development) more important
      than uncertain diachronic origin. {biblehub} {studylight}

# Synonym Network & Distinctions

    distinction_traditional: |
      Trench: ἀγαπάω = esteem-based love (Latin diligo); φιλέω = spontaneous affection
      (Latin amo). HELPS: agapaō = wholehearted/unconditional; phileo = sentimental/conditional. {trench} {helps}

    distinction_modern: |
      Carson and modern scholars: substantial semantic overlap in most contexts; John uses
      interchangeably for stylistic variation. Both can express divine and human love. {web-search-carson}

    semantic_overlap: |
      Both used for: (1) Father's love for Son, (2) Jesus' love for beloved disciple,
      (3) worldly/sinful affections. Context determines meaning, not lexical choice. {web-search-psephizo}

# Diachronic Development
diachronic_analysis:
  classical:
    period: "Homer → Classical (800 BCE - 300 BCE)"
    usage: |
      To greet with affection; show regard for deceased; love, prize, desire things;
      be fond of, prize above other things; be well pleased, contented. {studylight-lsj}

    semantic_range: "Broad - affection, preference, contentment"
    primary_sources: "Plato, classical authors {studylight-lsj}"
    note: "Less common than φιλέω in classical period"

  lxx:
    period: "LXX translation (250 BCE - 100 BCE)"
    occurrences: 215
    source: "{blb}"

    usage: |
      Primarily renders Hebrew אָהַב (ʾāháḇ, 'to love'); indicates covenant love,
      preferential affection. Purged of coldness found in classical Greek; deepened
      theological significance. {studylight}

    hebrew_equivalent: "H0157 אָהַב (ʾāháḇ)"
    note: |
      LXX usage established theological foundation for NT appropriation. Hebrew אָהַב
      covers full range of loves (divine, human, sexual, covenantal). {studylight}

  nt_koine:
    period: "NT writings (50 CE - 100 CE)"
    occurrences: 143
    source: "{blb}"

    specialization: |
      In NT, usually the active love of God for his Son and his people, and the active
      love his people are to have for God, each other, and even enemies. {studylight}

    distribution: |
      Concentrated in Johannine literature (John 38 instances; 1 John 28-30 instances).
      Also frequent in Paul, Synoptics, Peter. {biblehub}

    theological_development: |
      Commands love as moral duty, not merely emotional response. Love as fulfillment
      of law (ROM.013.010), identifying mark of disciples (JHN.013.035), eternal virtue
      (1CO.013.008,013). {biblehub}

    semantic_trajectory: |
      Classical broad usage → LXX covenant love → NT theological specialization
      (divine love, Christian ethic, ecclesial marker) while retaining ability to
      express negative preferences. {llm-cs45}

# Pedagogical Notes
pedagogical_notes:
  key_learning_points:
    - point: "Etymology uncertain despite common citation of 'from agan'"
      importance: "Teaches students to acknowledge uncertainty in lexical origins"

    - point: "Agapaō NOT always 'divine unconditional love'"
      evidence: "Used for loving darkness (JHN.003.019), worldly things (2TI.004.010)"
      importance: "Corrects popular misconception; emphasizes contextual usage"

    - point: "Agapaō/phileo distinction is contested"
      traditional: "Trench, HELPS make strong distinction"
      modern: "Carson, Das, Kostenberger view as substantially synonymous"
      importance: "Teaches students to navigate scholarly debates"

    - point: "Verb form more controversial than noun form (ἀγάπη)"
      explanation: |
        Noun ἀγάπη clearly specialized for spiritual/covenantal love; verb ἀγαπάω
        has broader usage including worldly preferences. {llm-cs45}

    - point: "LXX bridge between Hebrew and NT usage"
      explanation: |
        LXX translators chose ἀγαπάω to render Hebrew אָהַב, establishing theological
        foundation for NT writers. Understanding LXX usage essential for NT lexicography. {studylight}

  translation_implications:
    - issue: "Should translators distinguish agapaō and phileo in John 21?"
      traditional_practice: "Some older translations attempted distinction"
      modern_practice: "NIV, ESV, NASB, NLT use 'love' for both {llm-cs45}"
      recommendation: |
        Most modern translations recognize stylistic variation rather than semantic
        precision. Footnotes may note Greek word difference without claiming semantic distinction.

  exegetical_fallacies_to_avoid:
    - fallacy: "Etymological fallacy"
      description: "Assuming current meaning from uncertain ancient etymology"
      example: "Claiming agapaō means 'much love' from agan"
      correction: "Focus on synchronic usage (LXX, NT) not diachronic speculation"

    - fallacy: "Illegitimate totality transfer"
      description: "Importing all possible meanings into every occurrence"
      example: "Reading 'divine unconditional love' into every agapaō instance"
      correction: "Context determines which semantic range applies (JHN.003.019 ≠ JHN.003.016)"

    - fallacy: "Simplistic synonym distinction"
      description: "Assuming agapaō and phileo are always distinct"
      example: "John 21:15-17 distinction as exegetically determinative"
      correction: |
        Recognize John's stylistic variation; note both words used interchangeably
        elsewhere in Gospel; consider Aramaic substrate. {web-search-carson}
