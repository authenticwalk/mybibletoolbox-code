    power residing in a thing by virtue of its nature. Core semantic field
    centers on capability and potentiality. {strongs} {thayer} {abbott-smith}
    {lsj} {helps} {mounce}
```

**Grouped citations:** ✅ Six sources listed together showing agreement

**Etymology consensus:**
```yaml
etymology_consensus: |
  Unanimous agreement on derivation from verbal root δύναμαι (be able),
  with nominal form expressing the abstract concept of ability/capability
  rather than the act itself. {strongs} {thayer} {abbott-smith} {lsj}
```

**Result:** 100% - excellent convergence grouping with fair use compliance

---

### ✅ 5. Divergence noted in comparative context

**Status:** PASS

   - βία: forceful oppressive power
   - ἰσχύς: physical strength as endowment
   - κράτος: manifested sovereign power
   - ἐξουσία: delegated authority
   - ἐνέργεια: operative power in exercise

3. **Controversies** - Three documented with comparative analysis:
   - False etymology (dynamite) with refutation
   - Cessationism vs continuationism (ongoing debate)
   - Aristotelian philosophical usage vs NT theological usage

**Comparative framing:** ✅ All divergences explained in context with significance

**Result:** 100% - comprehensive comparative divergence documentation

**Result:** 100% - comprehensive cross-references

---

### ✅ 2. Diachronic analysis when relevant

**Status:** PASS

**Historical periods documented:**

1. **Classical (800-300 BCE):** Homer's bodily strength → Herodotus military forces → Plato/Aristotle philosophical abstraction → Euclid mathematical powers {lsj}

2. **Papyri (300 BCE - 300 CE):** Economic idiom κατὰ δύναμιν in marriage contracts; religious/magical intensification with Ramsay's pagan devotion evidence {studylight}

3. **LXX:** 383 occurrences translating 35+ Hebrew words; δύναμις already theological term for divine power {abbott-smith} {blb}

4. **NT/Koine:** Semantic narrowing toward theological/miraculous contexts; dominant applications in miracles, divine power, pneumatological empowerment {helps} {tdnt}

**Semantic trajectory:**
```yaml
semantic_trajectory: |
  Overall development: concrete physical strength (Homer) → abstract
  philosophical capacity (Aristotle) → religious/magical power (papyri) →
  theological divine capability (NT). Each stage retains core sense of
  inherent capability while adding specialized applications. {llm-cs45}
