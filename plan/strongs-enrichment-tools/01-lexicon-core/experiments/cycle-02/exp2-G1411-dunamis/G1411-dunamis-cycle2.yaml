etymology:
  root_word:
    strongs: G1410
    lemma: δύναμαι
    gloss: "can, be able, have power"
    relationship: "δύναμις derives from δύναμαι (to be able, can)" {strongs} {thayer} {biblehub}

  convergence:
    summary: |
      All lexicons agree: δύναμις denotes inherent power, ability, or capacity—
      power residing in a thing by virtue of its nature. Core semantic field
      centers on capability and potentiality. {strongs} {thayer} {abbott-smith}
      {lsj} {helps} {mounce}

    etymology_consensus: |
      Unanimous agreement on derivation from verbal root δύναμαι (be able),
      with nominal form expressing the abstract concept of ability/capability
      rather than the act itself. {strongs} {thayer} {abbott-smith} {lsj}

      theological_note: |
        Fundamental difference from external coercion—represents internal
        transformative capability. Not momentary display but sustained
        manifestation enabling progressive sanctification. {biblehub}

    - id: 5
      label: "Celestial Powers & Authority Figures"
      definition: |

        - ref: "Mat.24:29; Mrk.13:25; Luk.21:26"
          note: "αἱ δυνάμεις τῶν οὐρανῶν (powers of heavens = cosmic forces/stars)" {thayer}

      theological_note: |
        Reflects hierarchical cosmology of NT world—supernatural realm
        populated by powers, authorities, dominions. Δύναμις as category
        within angelic taxonomy. {biblehub}

    - id: 6
      label: "Resources & Economic Capacity"
      definition: |
        Pecuniary ability, wealth, material resources and means. Papyri evidence:
        κατὰ δύναμιν standard phrase in marriage contracts for economic ability.
        {abbott-smith} {thayer} {studylight}

      usage_context: |
        Economic idiom preserving original sense of capability—extends inherent
        ability concept to material domain {studylight}

      examples:
        - ref: "2Co.8:3"
          note: "κατὰ δύναμιν (according to means), παρὰ δύναμιν (beyond means)" {thayer}

# 3. HELPS WORD-STUDIES (Theological/Devotional Focus)
# ============================================================================

helps_word_study:
  definition: |
    Properly, ability to perform; for believers, power to achieve by applying
    the Lord's inherent abilities. {helps}

  emphasis: |
    Spiritual growth requires divine empowerment—believers access δύναμις not
    from self-generated capacity but by applying God's inherent abilities
    granted through the Spirit. {helps}

  application: |
    NT uses δύναμις 120 times emphasizing that true spiritual capability flows
    from union with Christ and Spirit indwelling, not human effort alone. {helps}

  pedagogical_note: |
    HELPS emphasizes practical distinction: inherent capacity (δύναμις) versus
    actual manifestation (ἐνέργεια), divine omnipotence versus delegated
    authority (ἐξουσία), miraculous power versus moral/spiritual strength. {helps}

# ============================================================================
# 5. CONTROVERSY & SCHOLARLY DEBATES
# ============================================================================

controversies:
  - type: "false_etymology"
    claim: |
      Popular sermon illustration claims δύναμις means "dynamite power" or
      "explosive power" because English "dynamite" derives from Greek δύναμις.
      {scribalcafe} {wordstudytools}

    refutation:
      time_frame_fallacy: |
        Approximately 1,800-year gap between NT composition (1st c.) and
        Alfred Nobel's invention of dynamite (1867). NT writers had zero
        concept of explosives. {scribalcafe}

      semantic_incompatibility: |
        Explosions are sudden, short-lived, momentary; δύναμις conveys
        long-lasting, enduring, sustained strength focused on ability and
        capability, not violent destruction. {wordstudytools}

      modern_greek_divergence: |
        Modern Greek uses entirely different vocabulary for explosions:
        ἀνατινάζω (blow up), έκρηξη (eruption). If δύναμις meant explosive
        power, these terms would be redundant. {wordstudytools}

      naming_convention: |
        Nobel followed scientific convention of using Greek/Latin roots for
        discoveries. He chose δύναμις because it means "power/force," not
        because ancient word meant explosives. Reverse etymological fallacy.
        {wordstudytools}

      scholarly_term: |
        Error represents "semantic back-formation and reconstruction"—
        retroactively projecting modern meaning onto ancient term. Also
        called "time-frame fallacy." {wordstudytools} {scribalcafe}

    legitimate_derivatives: |
      Δύναμις IS legitimate root of English "dynamic," "dynamo," "dynasty"—
      these preserve actual semantic continuity of power/force/capability.
      {llm-cs45}

    translation_impact: |
      False etymology produces distorted theology: portraying Holy Spirit as
      violent, destructive force rather than sustaining, empowering presence.
      Misrepresents biblical pneumatology. {llm-cs45}

  - type: "theological_controversy"
    claim: |
      Cessationism versus continuationism debate centers on whether miraculous
      δύναμις gifts (1Co.12:10 - working of miracles) continue today or ceased
      with apostolic age. {websearch}

    positions:
      - view: "Cessationism"
        description: |
          Miraculous δύναμις gifts were unique authentication for apostolic
          ministry and foundational revelation. With canon closure and apostolic
          succession ending, miraculous powers ceased. {websearch}
        proponents: "Reformed tradition, dispensationalism"

      - view: "Continuationism"
        description: |
          Miraculous δύναμις gifts remain active today as Spirit empowers
          believers for witness and ministry. No biblical text explicitly
          limits miracles to apostolic age. {websearch}
        proponents: "Pentecostal, charismatic, third-wave movements"

    significance: |
      Δύναμις becomes locus of ecclesiological and pneumatological debate—
      question of Spirit's ongoing activity and believers' access to
      supernatural empowerment. {llm-cs45}

  - type: "semantic_debate"
    claim: |
      Philosophers debate Aristotelian δύναμις (potentiality) versus ἐνέργεια
      (actuality)—whether term in Rhetoric means "ability/faculty" or
      "political influence/power." {websearch}

    context: |
      Classical philosophical usage differs from NT theological usage.
      Aristotle's δύναμις denotes capacity not yet actualized; NT usage
      emphasizes demonstrated capability and realized power. {lsj} {websearch}

    significance: |
      Diachronic semantic shift—from philosophical abstraction (potential
      versus actual) to theological concreteness (divine power manifest in
      miracles and salvation). {llm-cs45}

# ============================================================================
# 6. SYNONYM NETWORK & DISTINCTIONS
# ============================================================================

synonym_network:
  english_translation_collapse: |
    English "power" translates 5+ distinct Greek concepts, collapsing theological
    precision between inherent ability (δύναμις), physical strength (ἰσχύς),
    manifested power (κράτος), authority (ἐξουσία), and operative power (ἐνέργεια).
    {thayer} {abbott-smith} {biblehub}

  synonyms:
    - strongs: G1410
      lemma: δύναμαι
      gloss: "can, be able, have power"
      distinction: |
        Root verb—verbal action of being able. Δύναμις is nominal abstraction:
        the capability itself rather than the act of being capable. {strongs} {biblehub}

    - strongs: G970
      lemma: βία
      gloss: "force, violence"
      distinction: |
        Forceful, oppressive power in violent deeds; coercive external force.
        Δύναμις emphasizes inherent capability; βία emphasizes violent
        application against resistance. {thayer} {abbott-smith}

      contrast: |
        Βία appears only 3x in NT (Act.5:26, 21:35, 27:41) always with negative
        connotation (violence, compulsion). Δύναμις neutral or positive—
        capability without moral judgment on application. {llm-cs45}

    - strongs: G2479
      lemma: ἰσχύς
      gloss: "strength, might"
      distinction: |
        Strength especially physical, as endowment or natural possession.
        Δύναμις broader—includes physical but emphasizes functional capability
        and demonstrated ability, not mere endowment. {thayer} {abbott-smith}

      usage_pattern: |
        Ἰσχύς often paired with δύναμις (Eph.1:19, 2Th.1:9) showing
        complementarity: inherent strength (ἰσχύς) manifested as effective
        power (δύναμις). {biblehub}

    - strongs: G2904
      lemma: κράτος
      gloss: "power, dominion, might"
      distinction: |
        Manifested, relative power; dominion and sovereign control, chiefly
        of God in NT. Κράτος emphasizes displayed supremacy; δύναμις emphasizes
        inherent capacity underlying manifestation. {thayer} {abbott-smith}

      theological_usage: |
        Κράτος predominantly describes God's sovereign rule (1Ti.6:16, 1Pe.4:11,
        Rev.1:6); δύναμις describes both divine omnipotence and believer
        empowerment. Broader semantic range. {biblehub}

    - strongs: G1849
      lemma: ἐξουσία
      gloss: "authority, power, right"
      distinction: |
        Authority, delegated power, liberty of action, legal right. Ἐξουσία
        answers "by what right?"; δύναμις answers "by what capability?".
        Authority versus ability. {thayer} {abbott-smith} {biblehub}

      theological_significance: |
        Jesus possesses both: ἐξουσία (Mat.28:18 - all authority given) and
        δύναμις (Luk.4:14 - power of Spirit). Disciples receive both (Luk.9:1).
        Right to act requires ability to execute. {biblehub}

      practical_distinction: |
        Parent has ἐξουσία over child (authority/right to command) but may
        lack δύναμις (physical strength to enforce). Police officer has
        ἐξουσία (legal authority) and δύναμις (physical/institutional power).
        {llm-cs45}

    - strongs: G1753
      lemma: ἐνέργεια
      gloss: "working, operation, energy"
      distinction: |
        Working, operative power in exercise; actualized power producing
        effects. Ἐνέργεια emphasizes active operation; δύναμις emphasizes
        inherent capability (may be potential or active). {thayer} {abbott-smith}

      philosophical_background: |
        Aristotelian contrast: δύναμις (potentiality/capacity) versus
        ἐνέργεια (actuality/operation). NT retains distinction: δύναμις
        can be latent (Mat.25:15 - talents according to ability) or manifest;
        ἐνέργεια always denotes actualized working. {lsj} {llm-cs45}

# ============================================================================
# 7. DIACHRONIC DEVELOPMENT
# ============================================================================

diachronic_analysis:
  classical:
    period: "Homer → Classical (800-300 BCE)"
    usage: |
      Homer: bodily strength, physical might of warriors. Herodotus/Thucydides:
      military forces, armies (δύναμις ἀνδρῶν). Plato/Aristotle: philosophical
      abstraction—potentiality versus actuality, capacity versus operation.
      Mathematical: square, square root, power (Euclid). {lsj}

    emphasis: |
      Broad semantic range: physical strength → military power → intellectual
      capacity → mathematical concept. Foundational sense of capability
      underlying all applications. {lsj}

  papyri:
    period: "Hellenistic papyri (300 BCE - 300 CE)"
    documentary: |
      Economic idiom κατὰ δύναμιν ubiquitous in marriage contracts, legal
      documents, complaints: "according to means/ability." P.Oxy VI.899.8
      (A.D. 200): "as long as I had the power." {studylight}

    magical: |
      Ramsay: δύναμις characteristic terminology in pagan devotion and magical
      papyri. "Power" denotes divine manifestation worthy of worship. Religious
      intensification of secular term. {studylight}

    transition: |
      Economic usage continues (capability/resources) while religious/magical
      associations intensify. Term acquires theological weight as descriptor
      of supernatural power. {studylight}

  lxx:
    occurrences: 383
    source: "{blb}"
    hebrew_equivalents: |
      Translates 35+ Hebrew words including עֹז (strength), גְּבוּרָה (might),
      חַיִל (army/strength), צָבָא (host). Demonstrates semantic breadth—
      military, physical, divine power all mapped to δύναμις. {abbott-smith} {blb}

    usage_note: |
      LXX usage influences NT writers—δύναμις already theological term for
      divine power in Greek OT. NT inherits this semantic specialization. {llm-cs45}

  nt_koine:
    occurrences: 120
    source: "{blb}"
    specialization: |
      NT narrows semantic range toward theological/miraculous contexts while
      maintaining economic idioms. Dominant applications: (1) miraculous power
      validating divine authority, (2) divine omnipotence underlying creation/
      salvation, (3) pneumatological empowerment for believers. Classical
      breadth gives way to focused religious application. {helps} {tdnt}

    semantic_trajectory: |
      Overall development: concrete physical strength (Homer) → abstract
      philosophical capacity (Aristotle) → religious/magical power (papyri) →
      theological divine capability (NT). Each stage retains core sense of
      inherent capability while adding specialized applications. {llm-cs45}

      Strong preference for "power" reflects theological/miraculous contexts
      dominating NT usage. KJV translators recognized δύναμις as primary
      "power" word versus authority (ἐξουσία) or strength (ἰσχύς). {blb}
