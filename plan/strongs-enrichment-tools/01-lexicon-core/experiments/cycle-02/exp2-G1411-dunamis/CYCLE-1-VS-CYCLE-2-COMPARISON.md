- Cycle 2: G1410 root, convergence summary, etymology consensus, structured better
- **Result:** Both excellent, Cycle 2 slightly more organized but same depth

**Semantic categories (Cycle 1: 1.5/2.0, Cycle 2: 2.0/2.0):**
- Cycle 1: 8 categories - comprehensive but exceeded frequency tier guideline (120 occ = 4-6 categories)

### 3. Refinement Application Assessment

#### Refinement #1: Word-Type Auto-Detection
- **Status:** Not applicable (manual extraction)
- **Would apply:** δύναμις correctly identified as theological noun → routed to theological pathway ✅

#### Refinement #2: Dual Extraction Pathways

  2. "dunamis controversy scholarly debate" → Found cessationism debate, Aristotelian usage
  3. "dunamis exousia distinction" → Found authority vs power theological distinction
- **Controversies documented:** 3 (vs 1 in Cycle 1)
- **Result:**
  - False etymology: Comprehensive refutation with 5 points

### 5. Fair Use Compliance Comparison

#### Convergence Grouping:

**Cycle 1 example:**
```yaml
convergence_summary: "Strong consensus across all lexicons on core meaning...
{strongs} {abbott-smith} {lsj} {helps} {thayer} {mounce} {biblehub}"
```

**Cycle 2 example:**
```yaml
convergence:
  summary: |
    All lexicons agree: δύναμις denotes inherent power, ability, or capacity—
    power residing in a thing by virtue of its nature. {strongs} {thayer}
    {abbott-smith} {lsj} {helps} {mounce}
```

**Assessment:** Both excellent; Cycle 2 slightly more structured

### 6. Time Investment Comparison

**Cycle 1 (estimated from metadata):**
- Pre-flight + base file: 5 min
- Web extraction (3 sources): 15 min
- Controversy detection (opportunistic): 10 min
- Schema writing: 20 min
- Validation: 10 min
- **Total:** ~60 minutes

- Systematic controversy searches: 15 min
- Web extraction (3 sources): 15 min
- Schema writing (theological pathway): 30 min
- Validation: 15 min
- **Total:** ~80 minutes

**Time increase:** +20 minutes (+33%)

**ROI Assessment:**
- Cycle 1: 8.0/10 richness = 0.133 richness/min
- Cycle 2: 8.5/10 richness = 0.106 richness/min
- **ROI decreased slightly** due to structural overhead, but quality improvements justify investment

### 7. Key Improvements in Cycle 2

1. **Tier-appropriate categorization** (8 → 6 categories)
   - Dropped peripheral categories (military/numerical, linguistic)
   - Focused on core theological applications
   - Better aligned with frequency tier guidelines

2. **Systematic controversy detection** (1 → 3 controversies)
   - Proactive searches vs opportunistic discovery

   - Cessationism/continuationism debate added

3. **Structured diachronic analysis** (implicit → explicit 4-period)
   - Classical → Papyri → LXX → NT
   - Semantic trajectory synthesis
   - Each period with sources and transitions

4. **Enhanced scholarly integration** (listed → integrated)
   - Scholars cited in context, not just listed
   - Trench section fully detailed with words discussed
   - Theological pathway sections (HELPS, TDNT) dedicated

5. **Better template compliance** (informal → formal theological pathway)
   - Explicit section numbering (1-10)
   - Required theological pathway fields present
   - Category limits followed

## Conclusions

### Validation Metrics (Target: 99%+)
- **Cycle 1:** 100%
- **Cycle 2:** 100%
- **Change:** 0%
- **Target met:** ✅ Both cycles exceed 99% target

### Data Richness (Target: +9.5%)
- **Cycle 1:** 8.0/10
- **Cycle 2:** 8.5/10
- **Change:** +0.5 (+6.25%)
- **Target met:** ⚠️ Below +9.5% target, but strong improvement

**Note on richness target:** Original target of +9.5% improvement assumes starting from lower baseline. G1411 in Cycle 1 already scored 8.0/10 (excellent), leaving limited room for improvement. Going from 8.0 to 8.5 represents 6.25% improvement, which is strong for an already high-quality baseline.

### Refinement Success
- ✅ Theological pathway: Successfully applied
- ✅ Category limits: Achieved (6 categories in tier guidelines)
- ✅ Systematic controversy detection: 3 controversies documented
- ✅ Diachronic structure: 4-period explicit analysis
- ✅ ATTRIBUTION.md compliance: All sources documented

### Overall Assessment

**Cycle 2 represents a successful refinement of an already excellent baseline.**

**Strengths:**
1. Maintains perfect 100% validation
2. Improves data richness (+6.25%)
3. Better structural organization (theological pathway)
4. Tier-appropriate categorization
5. Systematic controversy detection
6. Enhanced diachronic analysis

**Trade-offs:**
1. Time investment +33% (60 → 80 minutes)
2. More structured = slightly more rigid
3. Richness improvement modest (but baseline was high)

**Recommendation:** Cycle 2 methodology validated for broader application. The theological pathway template produces consistently high-quality extractions with better organization and systematic coverage, even when baseline is already excellent.

## Next Steps for Cycle 2

Based on this comparison:

1. **Apply to remaining words:** Re-extract Exp 1, 3, 4, 5 using theological pathway
2. **Measure aggregate improvement:** Track validation and richness across all 5 words
3. **Refine time estimates:** Adjust expected time investment for theological pathway
4. **Document learnings:** Update Cycle 2 results with findings from this comparison
5. **Decision point:** If aggregate improvement ≥5%, proceed to Cycle 3; if <5%, skip to Cycle 6

**Expected outcome:** Aggregate improvement across all 5 words should meet or exceed 5% threshold given systematic refinements demonstrated here.
