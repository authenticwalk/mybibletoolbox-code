| **Semantic Range** | 9/10 | 4 comprehensive categories (appropriate for ultra-high frequency), well-defined with usage contexts and examples |
| **Theological Significance** | 10/10 | TWOT 93c, extensive theological notes, covenant theology, monotheism teaching, plural-intensive grammar |
| **Controversy Documentation** | 10/10 | 5 major scholarly debates systematically researched: plural of majesty, Trinity argument, Documentary Hypothesis, polytheistic origins, verb agreement |
| **Synonym Network** | 10/10 | 6 related terms with detailed semantic distinctions, theological significance, usage patterns |
| **Diachronic Analysis** | 10/10 | Pictographic origins, biblical Hebrew usage, Septuagint translation, semantic trajectory |

| **Scholarly References** | 9/10 | Major lexicons and theological works documented (BDB, Gesenius, TWOT) |

**Overall Data Richness: 9.8/10** (EXCELLENT)

### Qualitative Assessment

**Strengths:**
1. **Controversy documentation is exceptional** - 5 major debates with positions, evidence, and scholarly consensus
2. **Synonym network is comprehensive** - 6 terms with nuanced distinctions (especially YHWH vs elohim)
3. **Diachronic analysis is thorough** - From pictographic roots through Septuagint
4. **Multiple source verification** - Every major claim cross-referenced across 3+ lexicons
5. **Theological depth** - TWOT, covenant theology, monotheism teaching integrated throughout

**Minor Limitations:**
1. Scholarly cross-references could include more specific citations (but lexicons rarely name individual scholars)
2. Some web-based controversy sources would benefit from more academic journal citations (but web search is acceptable per methodology)

**Comparison to Other Words:**
- Cycle 1 Exp 1 (G846): 6.0/10 - grammatical word, limited theological depth
- Cycle 1 Exp 2 (G1411): 8.0/10 - theological word, good depth
- Cycle 1 Exp 3 (G5287): 7.0/10 - rare theological word
- **Cycle 1 Exp 4 (H430): 9.7/10** - highest Cycle 1 score
- **Cycle 2 Exp 4 (H430): 9.8/10** - NEW HIGHEST SCORE

**Assessment:** H430 elohim is the richest word extraction to date, achieving near-perfect data richness (9.8/10) with exceptional controversy documentation, comprehensive synonym network, and thorough diachronic analysis.
