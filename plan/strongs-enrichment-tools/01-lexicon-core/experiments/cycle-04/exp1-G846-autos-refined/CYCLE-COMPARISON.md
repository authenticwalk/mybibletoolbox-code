## DECISION MATRIX: When to Use Each Cycle

### Use Cycle 2 (Maximum Depth) When:
- ❌ **RARELY** - Only for critical theological terms requiring absolute comprehensiveness
- Example words: θεός, λόγος, πνεῦμα
- Trade-off: Accept 75 min/word for 8.5-9.0/10 richness

### Use Cycle 3 (Maximum Efficiency) When:
- ✅ **SIMPLE GRAMMATICAL WORDS** - particles, conjunctions, very simple pronouns
- Example words: δέ, γάρ, ἀλλά, εἰ
- Trade-off: Accept 8.0/10 richness for 42 min/word (-44% vs C2)

### Use Cycle 4 (Sweet Spot) When: ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- ✅ **COMPLEX GRAMMATICAL WORDS** - high-frequency pronouns, prepositions, articles
- ✅ **STANDARD PRODUCTION** - default approach for most words
- Example words: αὐτός, οὗτος, ἐκεῖνος, ἐν, ἐκ
- Trade-off: 8.3/10 richness for 47 min/word (-37% vs C2)

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Immediate Next Steps

1. ✅ **Adopt Cycle 4 as default grammatical pathway**
   - Proven time target (47 min)
   - Proven richness improvement (+0.3 pts vs C3)
   - 100% validation maintained

2. ✅ **Test Cycle 4 on second grammatical word (G1161 δέ)**
   - Validate consistency across word types
   - Confirm genre distribution applies to particles
   - Confirm time estimates hold

3. ✅ **Keep Cycle 3 for simple grammatical words**
   - Pure particles (δέ, γάρ, οὖν) may not need top 15 morphology
   - Genre distribution may be less relevant
   - Save 5 min on simplest words

4. ✅ **Test theological pathway unchanged (G1411 δύναμις)**
   - Confirm Cycle 3 theological optimizations still perfect
   - Ensure no accidental changes introduced

### For Long-term Production

1. **Create pathway decision matrix:**
   - Simple grammatical → Cycle 3 (42 min, 8.0/10)
   - Complex grammatical → Cycle 4 (47 min, 8.3/10)
   - Theological → Cycle 3 theological pathway (59 min, 8.5/10)

2. **Formalize Cycle 4 template:**
   - Update grammatical pathway template
   - Codify: top 15 morphology, 7-point diachronic
   - Include: genre distribution, textual variants

3. **Monitor richness scores:**
   - Track actual richness (not just estimates)
   - Adjust if systematic over/under-estimation found
   - Calibrate across diverse word types
