pedagogical_insights:
  learning_challenges:
    challenge_1:
      issue: "Distinguishing ἐκ from ἀπό (both can mean 'from')"
      resolution: "ἐκ emphasizes origin from within/interior, ἀπό emphasizes separation from surface/exterior; some contexts show overlap and manuscripts alternate {studylight} {lsj}"
      example: "ἐκ τοῦ ὕδατος = from inside water (immersion); ἀπὸ τοῦ ὕδατος = away from water (proximity)"
      source: "{studylight} {lsj}"

    challenge_2:
      issue: "Multiple semantic functions (spatial, causal, temporal, partitive)"
      resolution: "Context determines function - verb semantics and genitive object type provide clues (place noun = spatial, abstract noun = causal, collective noun = partitive) {biblehub}"
      pedagogical_strategy: "Teach decision tree: Is it location? → spatial. Is it agent/source? → causal. Is it group? → partitive."
      source: "{biblehub} {llm-cs45}"

    challenge_3:
      issue: "Theological weight in formulaic phrases (ἐκ πίστεως vs ἐξ ἔργων)"
      resolution: "Recognize technical theological vocabulary - these are not merely prepositional phrases but doctrinal formulas with centuries of interpretation {biblehub}"
      note: "Protestant-Catholic debates hinge on ἐκ πίστεως interpretation - students must know this history {llm-cs45}"
      source: "{biblehub}"

    challenge_4:
      issue: "Compound verb semantic contribution"
      resolution: "In compounds, ἐκ usually adds sense of 'out, away, off' or intensifies to completion; analyze base verb first, then add ἐκ modification {lsj}"
      example: "βάλλω (throw) + ἐκ = ἐκβάλλω (cast out, expel with force)"
      source: "{lsj} {studylight}"

    challenge_5:
      issue: "Phonetic alternation ἐκ/ἐξ - learners forget to apply before vowels"
      resolution: "Automatic phonetic rule - ἐξ before vowels (euphony), not semantic difference; practice recognition in reading {lsj}"
      source: "{lsj}"

scholarly_controversies:
  note: "SKIPPED - Grammatical function words (prepositions) rarely have scholarly controversies {llm-cs45}"

  semantic_overlap_note: "Minor scholarly discussion about ἐκ vs ἀπό semantic boundaries, but not significant controversy - manuscripts sometimes alternate without meaning change {studylight}"
