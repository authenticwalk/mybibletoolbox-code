**Word:** ἐκ (ek) - "out of, from"
**Strongs:** G1537
**Date:** 2025-11-11
**Pathway:** Grammatical Preposition (Cycle 4)

---

## Overall Richness Score: 8.5/10

**Target:** 8.3/10 (Cycle 4 grammatical target)
**Actual:** 8.5/10
**Variance:** +0.2 points (+2.4% above target) ✅

---

## Component Scoring (10 components × 1.0 pts each)

### 1. Etymology & Root Analysis (0.9/1.0)

**Score:** 0.9/1.0
**Strengths:**
- ✅ Identified as primary preposition (Indo-European origin)
- ✅ Phonetic alternation (ἐκ/ἐξ) documented
- ✅ Inscriptional variants noted (ἐγ-, ἐχ-)
- ✅ Core semantic essence explained ("from within to impact")
- ✅ Multiple lexicon convergence cited

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ No deep Indo-European etymology (expected for primary prepositions)

**Evidence:**
- "A primary preposition from ancient Indo-European {lsj} {studylight}"
- "Before vowels becomes ἐξ; rare variants ἐγ-/ἐχ- {lsj}"

---

### 2. Form Variants & Morphology (0.85/1.0)

**Score:** 0.85/1.0
**Strengths:**
- ✅ Both forms documented (ἐκ 665, ἐξ 235)
- ✅ Distribution percentages with source counts (74% vs 26%)
- ✅ Phonetic rule explained clearly
- ✅ Inscriptional variants noted
- ✅ Examples provided for both forms

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Only 2 forms (expected for prepositions - not a weakness per se)
- ⚠️ Could add more examples of ἐξ usage contexts

**Adaptation Note:** Prepositions don't have 15+ forms like pronouns, so this section is necessarily simpler but complete for the word type.

---

### 3. Functional Categories (1.0/1.0)

**Score:** 1.0/1.0 ⭐ **EXCELLENT**
**Strengths:**
- ✅ 6 comprehensive categories (spatial, partitive, causal, material, temporal, moral)
- ✅ Each category has gloss, frequency estimate, description, examples with citations
- ✅ Subcategories provided (spatial: emergence + position; causal: agency + origin)
- ✅ Theological significance noted (ἐκ θεοῦ regeneration)
- ✅ Examples span multiple NT books and genres

**Evidence:**
- Spatial: "~300-350 occurrences" with Mark 1:10, Matthew 2:15 examples
- Partitive: "~150-200 occurrences" with Matthew 1:3, John 7:40 examples
- Each category grounded in lexicon sources {biblehub} {lsj} {studylight}

---

### 4. Diachronic Analysis (0.9/1.0)

**Score:** 0.9/1.0
**Strengths:**
- ✅ 7-point analysis (Cycle 4 target achieved)
- ✅ Classical (Homer, Attic) → LXX → NT trajectory
- ✅ Genre distribution (Narrative, Epistolary, Apocalyptic)
- ✅ Textual stability analysis (mGNT 915, TR 917 - minimal variance)
- ✅ Hebraic influence documented (LXX 3,028 occurrences)
- ✅ Semantic expansion tracked (spatial → philosophical → theological)

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Could add more specific book counts for genre distribution

**Evidence:**
- Point 1: "Highly frequent in Homer - primarily spatial {lsj}"
- Point 3: "LXX 3,028 occurrences - Hebrew מִן translation {blb}"
- Point 7: "Minimal variance mGNT vs TR (2 occurrences) {blb}"

---

### 5. Syntax Patterns (1.0/1.0)

**Score:** 1.0/1.0 ⭐ **EXCELLENT**
**Strengths:**
- ✅ 7 comprehensive patterns documented
- ✅ Each pattern has structure, function, examples, frequency
- ✅ Wide variety: spatial, partitive, abstract, idiomatic, temporal, agency, internal source
- ✅ Examples cited with references (Mark 1:10, John 1:13, etc.)
- ✅ Pedagogical notes included

**Evidence:**
- Pattern 1: "ἐκ + Genitive Noun (Spatial)" - ~300+ occurrences
- Pattern 3: "ἐκ + Abstract Noun" - Pauline theology contexts
- Pattern 6: "ἐκ with Passive Verbs (Agency)" - Johannine concentration

---

### 6. Collocations (0.9/1.0)

**Score:** 0.9/1.0
**Strengths:**
- ✅ 7 major collocations documented
- ✅ Theological significance highlighted (ἐκ θεοῦ, ἐκ πίστεως)
- ✅ Frequency estimates for each
- ✅ Examples with citations (John 1:13, Romans 1:17, etc.)
- ✅ Notes on theological/contextual importance

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Could add cross-reference frequencies (exact counts if available)

**Evidence:**
- "ἐκ θεοῦ" - John 1:13 regeneration theology
- "ἐκ πίστεως" - Romans 1:17, Galatians 3:11 (Protestant Reformation theology)
- "ἐκ νεκρῶν" - ~40-50 occurrences (resurrection terminology)

---

### 7. Compound Formations (0.8/1.0)

**Score:** 0.8/1.0
**Strengths:**
- ✅ 6 compound verbs analyzed (ἐκβάλλω, ἐξέρχομαι, ἐκλέγομαι, etc.)
- ✅ Each compound shows base verb + ἐκ contribution
- ✅ Semantic force explained ("completion", "removal")
- ✅ Frequency notes provided
- ✅ Theological terms identified (ἐκλέγομαι = election)

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Could add more NT-specific frequency counts
- ⚠️ Could add more examples (dozens of ἐκ- compounds exist)

**Evidence:**
- "ἐκβάλλω: cast out - very common in Synoptic Gospels (exorcism)"
- "ἐξέρχομαι: go out - one of most frequent NT compound verbs"
- "Semantic force: expresses completion, like 'utterly' {lsj}"

---

### 8. Usage Statistics (0.85/1.0)

**Score:** 0.85/1.0
**Strengths:**
- ✅ Multiple text bases documented (mGNT 915, TR 917, LXX 3,028)
- ✅ Form distribution (ἐκ 665, ἐξ 235)
- ✅ KJV translation frequencies (all 7 renderings with counts)
- ✅ Genre distribution summary
- ✅ Comparison to Classical Greek noted

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Missing specific book-by-book counts (unavailable from sources)
- ⚠️ Could add more granular genre breakdown if data available

**Evidence:**
- "mGNT 915, TR 917 - high textual stability {blb}"
- "LXX 3,028 - 3x+ higher density than NT {blb}"
- KJV: "of" (366), "from" (181), "out of" (162), etc. {blb}

**Strengths:**
- ✅ 5 learning challenges identified
- ✅ Each challenge has resolution strategy
- ✅ Practical examples provided
- ✅ Theological implications addressed (ἐκ πίστεως Protestant-Catholic debates)
- ✅ Decision tree suggested for function disambiguation

**Evidence:**
- Challenge 1: "ἐκ vs ἀπό distinction" with resolution and examples
- Challenge 3: "Theological weight in formulaic phrases - Protestant-Catholic debates"
- Challenge 4: "Compound verb semantic contribution" with analysis strategy

---
