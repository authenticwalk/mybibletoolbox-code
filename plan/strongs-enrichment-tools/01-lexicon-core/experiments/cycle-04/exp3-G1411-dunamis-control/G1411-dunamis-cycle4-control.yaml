# Etymology & Root

etymology:
  root_word:
    strongs: G1410
    lemma: δύναμαι
    gloss: "can, be able, have power"
    relationship: "δύναμις derives from δύναμαι (to be able)" {strongs} {thayer} {biblehub} {abbott-smith}

  convergence:
    summary: |
      All lexicons agree: δύναμις denotes inherent power, ability, or capacity—
      power residing in a thing by virtue of its nature. Core semantic field
      centers on capability and potentiality. {strongs} {thayer} {abbott-smith}
      {lsj} {helps} {mounce}

    classical_development: |
      LSJ traces evolution: primary sense "power, might" in Homer (bodily strength),
      expanded meanings include capability, authority, military forces, natural
      capacity, and elemental forces. Fundamental concept: inherent capability
      or latent potential—power-as-resource rather than power-in-use. {lsj}

# HELPS Word-Studies

helps_word_study:
  definition: |
    Properly, ability to perform; for believers, power to achieve by applying
    the Lord's inherent abilities. {helps}

  emphasis: |
    Spiritual growth requires divine empowerment—believers access δύναμις not
    from self-generated capacity but by applying God's inherent abilities
    granted through the Spirit. {helps}

  application: |
    NT uses δύναμις 120 times emphasizing that true spiritual capability flows
    from union with Christ and Spirit indwelling, not human effort alone.
    Power through God's ability needed in every scene of life for sanctification
    and preparation for heaven. {helps}

# Controversy & Scholarly Debates

controversies:
  - type: "false_etymology"
    claim: |
      Popular sermon illustration claims δύναμις means "dynamite power" or
      "explosive power" because English "dynamite" derives from Greek δύναμις.
      {websearch}

    refutation:
      time_frame_fallacy: |
        Approximately 1,800-year gap between NT composition (1st c.) and
        Alfred Nobel's invention of dynamite (1867). NT writers had zero
        concept of explosives. Reverse etymological fallacy—termed by D.A. Carson
        as "semantic anachronism." {websearch}

      semantic_incompatibility: |
        Explosions are sudden, short-lived, momentary; δύναμις conveys
        long-lasting, enduring, sustained strength focused on ability and
        capability, not violent destruction. {websearch}

      naming_convention: |
        Nobel followed scientific convention of using Greek/Latin roots for
        discoveries. He chose δύναμις because it means "power/force," not
        because ancient word meant explosives. {websearch}

      scholarly_term: |
        Error represents "semantic back-formation and reconstruction"—
        retroactively projecting modern meaning onto ancient term. {websearch}

    translation_impact: |
      False etymology produces distorted theology: portraying Holy Spirit as
      violent, destructive force rather than sustaining, empowering presence.
      Misrepresents biblical pneumatology. {llm-cs45}

  - type: "theological_controversy"
    claim: |
      Cessationism versus continuationism debate centers on whether miraculous
      δύναμις gifts (1Co.12:10 - working of miracles) continue today or ceased
      with apostolic age. {websearch}

    positions:
      - view: "Cessationism"
        description: |
          Miraculous δύναμις gifts were unique authentication for apostolic
          ministry and foundational revelation. With canon closure and apostolic
          succession ending, miraculous powers ceased. Sign gifts given to
          authenticate apostles' message and NT church foundation. {websearch}

      - view: "Continuationism"
        description: |
          Miraculous δύναμις gifts remain active today as Spirit empowers
          believers for witness and ministry. No biblical text explicitly
          limits miracles to apostolic age. Charismata never ceased and will
          only cease at Christ's return. {websearch}

    significance: |
      Δύναμις becomes locus of ecclesiological and pneumatological debate—
      question of Spirit's ongoing activity and believers' access to
      supernatural empowerment. Both views agree God still works and does
      miracles; disagreement is what to expect as normative in church today.
      {llm-cs45} {websearch}

  - type: "semantic_debate"
    claim: |
      Philosophers debate Aristotelian δύναμις (potentiality) versus ἐνέργεια
      (actuality)—whether term means "ability/faculty" or "political influence/power."
      Translation remains contested: some leave terms untranslated because
      interpretation is what's at stake. {websearch}

    context: |
      Classical philosophical usage differs from NT theological usage.
      Aristotle's δύναμις denotes capacity not yet actualized; NT usage
      emphasizes demonstrated capability and realized power. Second sense
      of dunamis related not to movement (kinêsis) but to activity (energeia).
      {lsj} {websearch}

    significance: |
      Diachronic semantic shift—from philosophical abstraction (potential
      versus actual) to theological concreteness (divine power manifest in
      miracles and salvation). Aristotle thinks potentiality is indefinable,
      grasped only from consideration of cases. {llm-cs45} {websearch}

# Synonym Network (Top 5)

synonym_network:
  english_translation_collapse: |
    English "power" translates 5+ distinct Greek concepts, collapsing theological
    precision between inherent ability (δύναμις), strength (ἰσχύς), manifested
    power (κράτος), authority (ἐξουσία), and operative power (ἐνέργεια).
    {thayer} {trench}

  trench_section:
    reference: "Section xci"
    focus: "Miraculous terminology distinctions"
    key_distinction: |
      Trench characterizes δύναμις as "power, natural ability, general and
      inherent"—contrasting with related concepts. Section distinguishes
      τέρας (prodigy), σημεῖον (sign), δύναμις (power demonstration),
      μεγαλεῖον (magnificent deed). {trench} {blb}

  synonyms:
    - strongs: G2479
      lemma: ἰσχύς
      gloss: "strength, might"
      distinction: |
        Strength especially physical, as endowment or natural possession.
        Ἰσχύς denotes the ability to perform; δύναμις is actually performing
        and demonstrating that strength and ability. Δύναμις broader—includes
        physical but emphasizes functional capability. {thayer} {trench} {websearch}

    - strongs: G2904
      lemma: κράτος
      gloss: "power, dominion, might"
      distinction: |
        Manifested, relative power; dominion and sovereign control, chiefly
        of God in NT. Κράτος emphasizes displayed supremacy and power over
        others; δύναμις emphasizes inherent capacity underlying manifestation.
        Κράτος is no mere strength, but power over others. {thayer} {trench}
        {websearch}

    - strongs: G1849
      lemma: ἐξουσία
      gloss: "authority, power, right"
      distinction: |
        Authority, delegated power, liberty of action, legal right. Ἐξουσία
        answers "by what right?"; δύναμις answers "by what capability?".
        Authority versus ability. Δύναμις means capability to do something;
        ἐξουσία means authority or right to exercise that capability. {thayer}
        {trench} {biblehub} {websearch}

      theological_significance: |
        Jesus possesses both: ἐξουσία (Mat.28:18 - all authority given) and
        δύναμις (Luk.4:14 - power of Spirit). Right to act requires ability
        to execute. {biblehub}

    - strongs: G1753
      lemma: ἐνέργεια
      gloss: "working, operation, energy"
      distinction: |
        Working, operative power in exercise; actualized power producing
        effects. Ἐνέργεια has concept of movement, flow, the energy of;
        emphasizes active operation. Δύναμις emphasizes inherent capability
        (may be potential or active). {thayer} {trench} {websearch}

      philosophical_background: |
        Aristotelian contrast: δύναμις (potentiality) versus ἐνέργεια (actuality).
        NT retains distinction: δύναμις can be latent or manifest; ἐνέργεια
        always denotes actualized working. {lsj} {llm-cs45}

    - strongs: G970
      lemma: βία
      gloss: "force, violence"
      distinction: |
        Forceful, oppressive power in violent deeds; coercive external force.
        Δύναμις emphasizes inherent capability; βία emphasizes violent
        application against resistance. In Aeschylus, kratos and bia fasten
        Prometheus—most coercive and violent form of power. {thayer} {trench}
        {websearch}

      contrast: |
        Βία appears only 3x in NT (Act.5:26, 21:35, 27:41) always with negative
        connotation (violence, compulsion). Δύναμις neutral or positive. {llm-cs45}

# Diachronic Development

diachronic_analysis:
  pre_nt_development:
    period: "Classical → Hellenistic (800 BCE - 50 BCE)"

    semantic_progression: |
      Classical: Homer (bodily strength, physical might of warriors). Contested
      meaning—1919 study: physical force in Homer, royal/divine power in Hesiod.
      2018 study (David Lefebvre): kata dunamin expresses Greek "sense of measure"
      and "wisdom of limits." Plato: dunameis as "genus of beings" by which "we
      can do what we can do"—power and action, focusing on what a thing can do.
      Aristotle: dunamis became academic term for potentiality and actuality,
      principles for studying movement, causality, ethics, physiology. Euclid:
      mathematical power/square. Broad range: physical → military → intellectual →
      mathematical. {lsj} {websearch}

      Hellenistic: Economic idiom κατὰ δύναμιν standard in papyri (marriage
      contracts, legal documents). BGU IV.1050.14 (Augustan period) uses phrase
      "according to one's means." P Oxy II.282.8 (A.D. 30–35) has contrasting
      ὑπὲρ δύναμιν ("beyond one's means"). Religious intensification—δύναμις
      in magical papyri as divine manifestation worthy of worship. Ramsay notes
      characteristic terminology in pagan devotion—"power" represented fundamental
      attribute worshipped. {studylight} {websearch}

    trajectory: |
      Development: concrete physical strength → abstract philosophical capacity →
      religious/magical power. Economic usage stable; theological weight increasing.
      {lsj} {studylight}

  lxx_usage:
    occurrences: 383
    source: "{blb}"
    hebrew_equivalents: |
      Translates 35+ Hebrew words. Primary: חַיִל (chayil - army/strength, 138x),
      צָבָא (tsava - army/host, 113x), גְּבוּרָה (gevurah - might), עֹז (oz -
      strength), כֹּחַ (koach - power). Also: gibbor (warrior), chozeq (strength),
      kavod (glory), meod (very/much/"muchness"). Demonstrates semantic breadth—
      military, physical, divine power all mapped to δύναμις. {abbott-smith}
      {blb} {websearch}

    usage_note: |
      LXX usage influences NT writers—δύναμις already theological term for
      divine power in Greek OT. NT inherits this semantic specialization. {llm-cs45}

  nt_specialization:
    occurrences: 120
    source: "{blb}"
    specialization: |
      NT narrows semantic range toward theological/miraculous contexts while
      maintaining economic idioms. Dominant applications: (1) miraculous power
      validating divine authority, (2) divine omnipotence underlying creation/
      salvation, (3) pneumatological empowerment for believers. Classical
      breadth gives way to focused religious application. Most prevalent of
      Greek power words in NT. Inherent force flowing from person to give
      ability for supernatural things—miracles or morally excellent acts.
      {helps} {biblehub} {websearch}

    semantic_trajectory: |
      Overall development: concrete physical strength (Homer) → abstract
      philosophical capacity (Aristotle) → religious/magical power (papyri) →
      theological divine capability (NT). Each stage retains core sense of
      inherent capability while adding specialized applications. {llm-cs45}
