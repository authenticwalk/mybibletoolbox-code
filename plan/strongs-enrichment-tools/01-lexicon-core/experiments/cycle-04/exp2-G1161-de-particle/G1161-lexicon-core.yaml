# ============================================================================
# ETYMOLOGY
# ============================================================================
etymology:
  classification: "Primary particle (not derived from other Greek roots)" #{blb-strongs}
  historical_origin: "Originally an adverb with force 'on the other hand' or 'on the contrary', evolved into a conjunction in Classical Greek" #{perseus-smyth}
  related_forms:
    - term: δή
      relationship: "Etymologically related particle; δέ relates to δή as μέν to μήν" #{blb-thayer}
      distinction: "δή is more emphatic/affirmative, δέ is contrastive/continuative"
  semantic_core: "Marks contrast or transition between discourse units; signals that something is different from what precedes but without strong opposition" #{perseus-smyth}

# ============================================================================
# USAGE PATTERNS (Particle-Specific - replaces traditional morphology)

      frequency: "Common but less dominant than in Koine; stronger competition from other particles" #{llm-cs45}
      usage: "Full range of adversative and copulative functions; apodotic δέ very common in Homer and Herodotus" #{perseus-smyth}

    - period: "Hellenistic/Early Koine (3rd-1st c. BCE)"
      status: "Increased dominance as particle system simplified" #{lxx-discourse-markers}

    - period: "New Testament Era (1st c. CE)"
      status: "One of most frequent words (5th overall); dominant narrative connective" #{nt-vocab-freq}
      frequency: "2,792-2,883 occurrences across ~27 NT books" #{blb-strongs}
      usage_patterns: "Genre-dependent: very high in narratives, moderate in epistles, low in Johannine writings and Revelation" #{blb-thayer}
      stylistic_role: "Creates characteristic NT 'cadence' distinguishing Greek narrative style" #{biblehub-g1161}

  genre_distribution_evolution:
    - genre: "Narrative Gospels and Acts"
      frequency: "Very high density; primary inter-clause connective" #{blb-thayer}
      function_emphasis: "Copulative/continuative and transitional functions dominate; creates rhythmic flow" #{biblehub-g1161}

    - genre: "Pauline Epistles"
      frequency: "Moderate to high; concentrated in argumentative sections" #{llm-cs45}
      function_emphasis: "Adversative and apodotic functions prominent; structures logical contrasts" #{llm-cs45}
      distinctive_pattern: "Higher use of μέν...δέ correlative constructions than in narrative genres" #{llm-cs45}

    variation_types: "Most variants involve δέ vs. γάρ or δέ vs. καί substitutions rather than omissions" #{llm-cs45}
    critical_significance: "Stability suggests copyists recognized δέ's functional importance in discourse structure" #{llm-cs45}

# ============================================================================
# PEDAGOGICAL INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
pedagogical_insights:
  - insight: "δέ's postpositive nature allows Greek to front-load emphasis while signaling clause relationships"
    teaching_value: "Helps students understand Greek word order flexibility and information structure" #{llm-cs45}

  - insight: "Traditional 'adversative vs. copulative' distinction often unhelpful; δέ functions as single development marker with context-dependent interpretation"
    teaching_value: "Discourse grammar approach simplifies learning and improves reading fluency" #{runge-dg}

  - insight: "δέ's high frequency (5th most common word) makes it essential for natural Greek reading; learning to 'feel' its rhythm improves comprehension"
    teaching_value: "Students should practice reading aloud to internalize δέ's discourse-structuring cadence" #{biblehub-g1161}
