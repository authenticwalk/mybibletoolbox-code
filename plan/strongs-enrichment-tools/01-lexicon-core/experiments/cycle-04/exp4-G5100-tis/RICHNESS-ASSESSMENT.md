## Comparison to Cycle 4 Other Grammatical Words

| Word | Type | Cycle | Time | Richness | Notes |
|------|------|-------|------|----------|-------|
| **G846 αὐτός** | Pronoun | C4 | 47 min | 8.3/10 | Ultra-high freq (5,597) |
| **G1161 δέ** | Particle | C4 | 48 min | 8.9/10 | Particle excellence |
| **G5100 τις** | Pronoun | C4 | 48 min | 8.3/10 | Medium-high freq (526) |

**Analysis:**
- G5100 matches G846 richness (8.3/10) despite lower frequency
- Both pronouns achieve same richness at 47-48 min (consistent)
- Particles (δέ) achieve higher richness (8.9/10) due to simpler structure
- Cycle 4 grammatical pathway performs consistently across word types

---

## Strengths

1. **Interrogative vs Indefinite Focus:** ✅ Core distinction excellently maintained throughout
2. **Cycle 4 Refinements:** ✅ Both refinements perfectly implemented (morphology 90.9%, diachronic 7 points)
3. **Pedagogical Value:** ✅ 4 insights with clear learning challenges and resolutions
4. **Comprehensive Syntax:** ✅ 7 patterns covering all major NT usage contexts
5. **Genre Analysis:** ✅ Narrative vs epistolary distribution well-documented

---

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Cross-references:** Add formal link to G5101 (τίς interrogative)
2. **Word family:** Mention compound indefinite pronouns (ὅστις, etc.)
3. **Gender ambiguity:** Slightly more detail on m/f gender contextual determination

**Impact:** LOW (minor enhancements, core extraction excellent)

---

## Final Assessment

**Richness Score:** 8.3/10 ✅ **EXCEEDED TARGET (8.2/10)**

**Quality Tier:** Production-ready, Cycle 4 compliant

**Recommendation:** ✅ **APPROVE FOR PRODUCTION**

**Key Achievement:** Successfully demonstrated that Cycle 4 grammatical pathway achieves 8.3/10 richness at 48 min for medium-frequency pronouns, confirming scalability beyond ultra-high frequency words (G846)
