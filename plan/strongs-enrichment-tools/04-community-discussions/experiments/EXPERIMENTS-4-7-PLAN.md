# Experiments 4-7 Plan: Testing Remaining Error Types

**Created:** 2025-11-12
**Purpose:** Validate Tool 4 methodology across all 7 error types
**Status:** Planning phase

---

## Completed Experiments (1-3)

✅ **Exp 1:** G1411 δύναμις - Etymological fallacy (chronological anachronism)
✅ **Exp 2:** G1577 ἐκκλησία - Etymological fallacy (root fallacy subtype)
✅ **Exp 3:** H430 אֱלֹהִים - Theological projection

**Validation:** All 3 passed L1:100%, L2:100%, L3:88%

---

## Remaining Error Types to Test

### Error Type 4: Over-Specification
**Definition:** Adding specific details not present in the word's meaning

**Needs testing:** ❌ Not yet validated

---

### Error Type 3: False Cognates
**Definition:** Assuming similar-sounding words are related without evidence

**Needs testing:** ❌ Not yet validated

---

### Error Type 5: Lexical Maximalism
**Definition:** Claiming all senses of a word apply simultaneously

**Needs testing:** ❌ Not yet validated

---

### Error Type 7: Selective Definition
**Definition:** Ignoring semantic range, selecting only one sense

**Needs testing:** ❌ Not yet validated

---

## Experiment 4: Over-Specification

### Target Error Type
**Pattern 4:** Over-specification (adding details not in the word)

### Candidate Words

**Option 1: G5479 χαρά (chara - joy) - RECOMMENDED**

**Why this word:**
- ✅ Abstract emotion word (high over-specification risk)
- ✅ Known error: "Joy means 'jumping for joy'" (physical action added)
- ✅ Common sermon illustration (widespread)
- ✅ Multiple refutation sources available

**Predicted error:**
```
"Joy (chara) literally means 'jumping for joy' - physical exuberance"
OR
"Chara means more than happiness; it's a deep-seated, full-body joy"
```

**Search strategy:**
- `"chara" + "jumping for joy"` OR `"jumping" + "joy" + "Greek"`
- `"chara literally means"` + `"physical"` OR `"body"`
- `"joy vs happiness" + "Greek" + "chara"`

**Expected refutation:**
- BDAG: "joy, gladness, source of joy" - no physical action
- Lexical definition doesn't include bodily expressions
- Over-specification adds details not in the word

**Risk factors:**
- Theological Impact: LOW (devotional error, not doctrinal)
- Propagation: WIDESPREAD (common illustration)
- Sensitivity: LOW (easy to correct graciously)

---

**Option 2: H7965 שָׁלוֹם (shalom - peace/welfare)**

**Why this word:**
- ✅ Known error: "Shalom means 'nothing missing, nothing broken'"
- ✅ Extremely widespread in teaching
- ✅ Hebrew word with rich meaning (tempts over-specification)

**Predicted error:**
```
"Shalom doesn't just mean peace; it means complete wholeness,
nothing missing, nothing broken, total wellness"
```

**Search strategy:**
- `"shalom" + "nothing missing nothing broken"`
- `"shalom means more than peace"`
- `"shalom" + "wholeness" + "complete"`

**Expected refutation:**
- BDB: "completeness, soundness, welfare, peace"
- "Nothing missing, nothing broken" adds specificity beyond lexicon
- Valid semantic range but over-specified in popular teaching

---

**RECOMMENDATION: Start with G5479 χαρά (Option 1)**
- More clear-cut error (physical action added)
- Better documented in sources
- Greek word (balances Hebrew Exp 3)

---

## Experiment 5: False Cognates

### Target Error Type
**Pattern 3:** False cognates (phonetic similarity ≠ semantic relationship)

### Candidate Words

**Option 1: G5368 φιλέω (phileō - to love) - RECOMMENDED**

**Why this word:**
- ✅ Sounds like English "feel" (phonetic similarity)
- ✅ Likely errors: "Phileo is 'feeling' love" vs. agape as "choice" love
- ✅ Phonetic connection tempting for English speakers

**Predicted error:**
```
"Phileo (sounds like 'feel') is emotional love based on feelings,
while agape is volitional love based on choice"
```

**Search strategy:**
- `"phileo" + "feel"` OR `"feeling love"`
- `"phileo vs agape" + "emotional vs volitional"`
- `"phileo sounds like feel"`

**Expected refutation:**
- BDAG: "to have a warm regard for, to love" - no distinction based on "feeling"
- Phonetic similarity to English "feel" is coincidental
- Phileo/agape overlap significantly in NT (John 21:15-17 interchangeable)
- Distinction is theological construction, not lexical

**Risk factors:**
- Theological Impact: MEDIUM (affects love theology)
- Propagation: EPIDEMIC (widely taught distinction)
- Sensitivity: MEDIUM (challenges popular teaching)

---

**Option 2: H1696 דָּבָר (dabar - word/thing)**

**Why this word:**
- ✅ Sounds like English "debar" (exclude)
- ✅ Could have false connection errors

**Predicted error:**
```
"Dabar (sounds like 'debar') means to exclude or cut off"
```

**Search strategy:**
- `"dabar" + "debar"` OR `"exclude"`
- `"dabar sounds like"`

**Expected refutation:**
- BDB: "speech, word, thing" - no connection to "debar"
- Phonetic similarity to English is coincidental

---

**RECOMMENDATION: Start with G5368 φιλέω (Option 1)**
- More documented error (phileo vs agape distinction widespread)
- Clear phonetic connection temptation
- Important theological implications to clarify

---

## Experiment 6: Lexical Maximalism

### Target Error Type
**Pattern 5:** Lexical maximalism (claiming all senses apply simultaneously)

### Candidate Words

**Option 1: G3056 λόγος (logos - word/reason/message) - RECOMMENDED**

**Why this word:**
- ✅ Rich semantic range (word, reason, message, discourse, principle)
- ✅ Likely error: "Logos means ALL of these at once in John 1:1"
- ✅ Christological significance (high-stakes theology)
- ✅ Temptation to "load" the word with all meanings

**Predicted error:**
```
"Logos means word AND reason AND divine speech AND ordering principle
all at the same time - this is why Jesus is called the Logos"
```

**Search strategy:**
- `"logos" + "means word and reason"` OR `"all meanings"`
- `"logos John 1:1" + "comprehensive meaning"`
- `"logos" + "etymology" + "stacking definitions"`

**Expected refutation:**
- BDAG: Semantic range exists, but context determines which sense
- John 1:1 likely emphasizes "word/message" (communication), not all senses
- Lexical maximalism conflates semantic range with simultaneous meaning
- Scholars: context selects meaning, doesn't activate all meanings

**Risk factors:**
- Theological Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH (Christology affected)
- Propagation: WIDESPREAD (common in apologetics)
- Sensitivity: MEDIUM (challenges Christological apologetics)

---

**Option 2: G4151 πνεῦμα (pneuma - spirit/wind/breath)**

**Why this word:**
- ✅ Multiple senses (spirit, wind, breath)
- ✅ Temptation: "All senses active in John 3:8 (wind/Spirit wordplay)"

**Predicted error:**
```
"Pneuma means wind AND spirit AND breath all at once,
showing the connection between breath and Spirit"
```

**Search strategy:**
- `"pneuma" + "wind and spirit"` OR `"all meanings"`
- `"pneuma John 3:8" + "wordplay"`

**Expected refutation:**
- BDAG: Semantic range, but context determines sense
- Wordplay may be intentional (John 3:8), but doesn't mean all senses activated
- Distinguish semantic range from lexical maximalism

---

**RECOMMENDATION: Start with G3056 λόγος (Option 1)**
- Classic example of maximalism (well-documented)
- High theological significance (Christology)
- Important to clarify for apologetics

---

## Experiment 7: Selective Definition

### Target Error Type
**Pattern 7:** Selective definition (ignoring semantic range, picking one sense)

### Candidate Words

**Option 1: G26 ἀγάπη (agapē - love) - RECOMMENDED**

**Why this word:**
- ✅ Known error: "Agape ALWAYS means unconditional love" (ignores range)
- ✅ Selective definition imposed (Reformed theology)
- ✅ Ignores contexts where agape ≠ unconditional

**Predicted error:**
```
"Agape always means unconditional, sacrificial love - distinct from phileo"
```

**Search strategy:**
- `"agape" + "always means unconditional"`
- `"agape vs phileo" + "distinction"`
- `"agape does not always mean unconditional"`

**Expected refutation:**
- BDAG: "love, affection, esteem, favor" - broader semantic range
- NT contexts where agape ≠ unconditional (2 Tim 4:10 "loved this world")
- Agape/phileo used interchangeably (John 21:15-17)
- Selective definition ignores semantic range

**Risk factors:**
- Theological Impact: MEDIUM (love theology)
- Propagation: EPIDEMIC (extremely widespread)
- Sensitivity: MEDIUM-HIGH (challenges Reformed teaching)

---

**Option 2: H430 אֱלֹהִים (Elohim - God/gods)**

**Why this word:**
- ✅ Already tested in Exp 3 for theological projection
- ✅ Could also test for selective definition: "ONLY means true God" (ignoring plural uses)

**Predicted error:**
```
"Elohim ONLY refers to the true God, never to false gods"
```

**Search strategy:**
- `"elohim only true God"`
- `"elohim never means false gods"`

**Expected refutation:**
- BDB: Used for true God AND false gods (contextual)
- Selective definition ignores OT usage for pagan deities
- Context determines referent

**Note:** Already covered in Exp 3, so less valuable for validation

---

**RECOMMENDATION: Start with G26 ἀγάπη (Option 1)**
- Classic selective definition error (widespread)
- Complements Exp 5 (phileo) by addressing other side of distinction
- Critical for love theology clarity

### Sequential Order

**Recommended order:**

1. **Exp 4:** G5479 χαρά (simplest - physical action added)
2. **Exp 5:** G5368 φιλέω (introduces phonetic errors)
3. **Exp 7:** G26 ἀγάπη (completes phileo/agape analysis)
4. **Exp 6:** G3056 λόγος (most complex - multiple senses)

**Rationale:** Build from simplest to most complex; Exp 5 + 7 pair well together
