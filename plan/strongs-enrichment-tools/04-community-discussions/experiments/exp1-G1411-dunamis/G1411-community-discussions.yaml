    error:
      claim: |
        "Dunamis is where we get the word 'dynamite', showing the gospel is the explosive power of God."
        Variant: "The Greek word for power (dunamis) means dynamite, revealing God's explosive power."

      type: "etymological_fallacy"
      # Primary: etymological_fallacy (claiming ancient word derives from modern invention)
      # Contributing: anachronism (importing 19th-century concept into 1st-century text)

      prevalence: "widespread"

      why_tempting: |
        Etymology feels like unlocking "secret meaning" that the average person doesn't know.
        "Explosive power" is memorable, vivid, and creates dramatic sermon illustrations.
        The phonetic connection (dunamis → dynamite) seems obvious and scholarly.
        Makes ancient text feel relevant to modern technology/experience.
        Creates an "aha moment" in teaching that is hard to forget.
        Alliteration and wordplay are powerful teaching tools.

    # === SCHOLARLY REFUTATION ===
    scholarly_refutation:
      correction: |
        Dunamis CANNOT derive from "dynamite" - chronologically impossible.
        The causation runs the opposite direction: Nobel borrowed the Greek word dunamis in 1867
        to name his newly invented explosive, precisely BECAUSE dunamis means "power/strength."
        This is reverse etymology compounded by anachronism.

            key_point: "NT δύναμις grounded in OT theology of divine power, not Greek etymology"

      correct_understanding:
        etymology: |
          δύναμις derives from δύναμαι (to be able, to have power) {bdag} {lsj}
          Root meaning: inherent ability, capability, strength

        semantic_range: |
          1. Power, might, strength, force {bdag}
          2. Ability, capability {bdag}
          3. Meaning, significance {bdag}
          4. Deed of power, miracle (οἱ δυνάμεις) {bdag}
          5. Powerful person, supernatural power/being {bdag}

        proper_usage: |
          NT writers used δύναμις to convey God's inherent power and ability.
          Romans 1:16 emphasizes divine power for salvation, NOT destructive force.
          OT background: Personal God who possesses power and manifests it in deliverance {moo-romans}
          The gospel's power is transformative, not explosive; spiritual, not physical.

    # === PEDAGOGICAL GUIDANCE ===
    helpful_guidance:
      what_to_avoid: |
        Do NOT claim dunamis comes from or is related to dynamite.
        Do NOT import 19th-century explosives imagery into 1st-century text.
        Do NOT use chronologically impossible word connections.
        Do NOT assume English word similarity indicates etymological connection.
        Avoid: "The Greek word literally means dynamite" (false).
        Avoid: "Explosive power of the gospel" (imports wrong connotation).

      alternative_framing: |
        δύναμις (from δύναμαι 'to be able') emphasizes God's inherent ability and strength.
        The gospel is God's POWER - His effective ability to accomplish salvation.
        Romans 1:16: God's power works transformation, not destruction.
        Think: capacity, capability, might, strength - ongoing, sustaining power.
        OT background: God who possesses and manifests power to deliver His people {moo-romans}

        Valid connection: English "dynamic" (active, energetic) DOES relate to dunamis.
        The gospel is dynamic (active, effective), not destructive.

      memory_aid: |
        Valid English derivatives from δύναμις:
        - "Dynamic" (energetic, active) ✅
        - "Dynamo" (power generator) ✅
        - "Dynasty" (powerful rulers) ✅
        These existed BEFORE 1867 and don't imply explosives.

        Misleading connection:
        - "Dynamite" (explosive invented 1867) ❌ - reverse borrowing, anachronistic

      tone_note: |
        Be gracious: "While this sermon illustration is common and memorable,
        the chronology shows it's impossible for NT writers to have had
        explosives in mind. The actual meaning is even more powerful -
        God's inherent, sustaining ability to save."

    question: "Does dunamis really mean explosive power like dynamite?"

    source:
      platform: "web_search_reveals"
      context: "Commonly asked in Bible study groups, sermons address it"
      prevalence: "Very frequent - found in devotionals, teaching sites"

    community_answers:
      - answer: "Yes, dunamis is where we get dynamite, showing God's explosive power"
        authority_assessment: "LOW - perpetuates error"
        problems:
          - "Chronologically impossible"
          - "Reverses direction of borrowing"
          - "Anachronistic"

      - answer: "The connection is illustrative, not etymological"
        authority_assessment: "MEDIUM - partially correct"
        problems:
          - "Still implies connection that misleads"
          - "Better to avoid entirely due to anachronism"

    expert_answer:
      answer: |
        No. Dunamis cannot mean "dynamite" or "explosive power" because:

        1. **Chronology:** NT written 50-100 CE; dynamite invented 1867 CE (1800-year gap) {historical-record}
        2. **Direction:** Nobel BORROWED Greek word dunamis to NAME his invention {scribal-cafe}
        3. **Etymology:** δύναμις derives from δύναμαι (to be able) - means power, might, strength {bdag}
        4. **Context:** 1st-century readers had zero concept of chemical explosives {llm-cs45}
        5. **Semantics:** Importing "explosive" connotation is anachronistic retrospective eisegesis {maustsontoast-blog}

        D.A. Carson calls this a word-study fallacy - semantic anachronism {carson-fallacies}

        **Actual meaning:** Inherent power, ability, strength, capability - God's effective power to save {bdag} {moo-romans}

    question: "Why do so many preachers say dunamis means dynamite if it's wrong?"

    source:
      platform: "implied_by_prevalence"
      context: "Widespread use raises question about why error persists"

    expert_answer:
      answer: |
        Several reasons explain persistence of this error:

        1. **Memorable:** Alliteration and vivid imagery stick in memory {llm-cs45}
        2. **Preaching:** Effective sermon illustrations get repeated, even if inaccurate
        3. **Phonetic:** Dunamis SOUNDS like dynamite - seems scholarly
        4. **Dramatic:** "Explosive power" more exciting than "ability/strength"
        5. **Tradition:** Once popularized, hard to correct - appears in published materials
        6. **Intention:** Preachers mean well - trying to make text relevant

        However: "It may preach, but it's not correct!" {maustsontoast-blog}

        Accuracy matters. Better illustrations don't require chronological impossibility.
