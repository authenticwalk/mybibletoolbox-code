      why_tempting: |
        Etymology provides memorable identity ("we are the called-out ones").
        Ek + kaleo breakdown feels scholarly and insightful.
        Reinforces theological concept of separation from the world.
        Creates strong church identity and mission clarity.
        Simple, teachable, memorable for congregations.
        Appears to unlock "original meaning" of Scripture.

    # === SCHOLARLY REFUTATION ===
    scholarly_refutation:
      correction: |
        While ekklesia etymologically derives from ek + kaleo, this root meaning does NOT
        determine its actual usage. By NT times, ekklesia simply meant "assembly" or "congregation."
        Etymology ≠ meaning (root fallacy). Classical and NT usage = "assembly," not "called out ones."

      correct_understanding:
        etymology: |
          Yes, ekklesia derives from ek (out) + kaleo (to call) {lsj}
          Original usage: citizens called out (to assemble point) for political meetings {nidntte}
          But: etymological origin ≠ established meaning

        semantic_range: |
          1. Assembly, congregation (general gathering) {bdag}
          2. Political assembly of citizens {lsj}
          3. Congregation of Israel (LXX usage) {bdag}
          4. Christian congregation/church (NT usage) {bdag}

        proper_usage: |
          NT writers used ekklesia to mean "assembly" or "congregation" - the standard meaning
          in their day. Hearers would think "gathering/assembly," not analyze etymology.
          The theological concept of being "called out" is valid (1 Peter 2:9 uses different
          words), but ekklesia itself simply means "assembly/church" {bdag} {carson-fallacies}

    # === PEDAGOGICAL GUIDANCE ===
    helpful_guidance:
      what_to_avoid: |
        Do NOT claim ekklesia "means" called out ones.
        Do NOT assume etymology determines meaning (root fallacy).
        Do NOT teach that ek + kaleo breakdown reveals the word's NT sense.
        Avoid: "Ekklesia literally means 'the called-out ones'" (false).

      alternative_framing: |
        Ekklesia in NT = "assembly" or "congregation/church" {bdag}

        VALID theological teaching:
        - God HAS called believers out of darkness (1 Peter 2:9 - different words)
        - Church IS a called people (klētoi, elect) - valid theology
        - Ekklesia DESCRIBES this called assembly

        Accurate teaching:
        "Ekklesia means 'assembly' or 'church.' While the word originally referred to
        citizens called to assemble, by NT times it simply meant 'gathering.' The church
        IS a called people (theology), but the word ekklesia itself means 'assembly.'"

      memory_aid: |
        Think: Ekklesia = Assembly/Church (what hearers understood)
        Not: Ek + kaleo analysis (etymology ≠ usage meaning)

        Valid connection: Church IS called by God (different Greek words: kaleo, kletos)
        Invalid: Ekklesia MEANS "called out" (etymology imposed on meaning)

      tone_note: |
        Be gracious: "While this teaching is widespread and reinforces important theology
        (believers ARE called out), the linguistic evidence shows ekklesia itself simply
        meant 'assembly.' The theology is sound - the etymology just doesn't carry the
        meaning into the word."

# === COMMON QUESTIONS ===

    question: "Doesn't ekklesia come from ek + kaleo, meaning 'called out'?"

    source:
      platform: "common_teaching_question"
      context: "Frequently taught in churches; challenged by Greek students"

    expert_answer:
      answer: |
        Yes, ekklesia etymologically derives from ek (out) + kaleo (to call). BUT:

        **Etymology ≠ Meaning** (D.A. Carson's "root fallacy" {carson-fallacies})

        1. **Original usage:** Citizens called out to assembly point for political meetings {nidntte}
        2. **Meaning development:** Over time, "assembly" became the established meaning
        3. **NT usage:** Simple word for "assembly/congregation" - etymology no longer active
        4. **Hearer understanding:** 1st-century hearers thought "assembly," not "called-out" {ednt}

        **Analogy:** "Understand" comes from "under + stand," but nobody thinks of physical
        standing when hearing "I understand." Etymology ≠ current meaning.

        **Lexicons agree:** BDAG, LSJ, NIDNTTE all define as "assembly," not "called out ones" {bdag} {lsj} {nidntte}

    question: "Is it wrong to teach that the church is 'called out' from the world?"

    source:
      platform: "theological_question"
      context: "Concern that correction undermines theology"

    expert_answer:
      answer: |
        No! The THEOLOGY is sound - believers ARE called out. The ETYMOLOGY is the issue.

        **Valid theology:**
        - 1 Peter 2:9: "called (καλέω/kaleo) out of darkness" - correct verb!
        - Ephesians 1:4: God "chose (ἐκλέγομαι/eklegomai) us" - selection language
        - Romans 1:6: "called (κλητός/kletos) to belong to Jesus" - called ones

        **Invalid etymology:**
        - Claiming ekklesia itself MEANS "called out ones" {reformed-reader-blog}

        **Solution:**
        Teach the theology using the RIGHT Greek words (kaleo, kletos, eklegomai).
        Use ekklesia correctly as "assembly/church."

        **Accurate:** "The church (ekklesia = assembly) consists of those called (kaleo)
        by God out of darkness. We are the called ones (kletos) who assemble (ekklesia)."
