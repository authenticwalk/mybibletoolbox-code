"Dunamis is where we get the word 'dynamite', showing God's
explosive power to save us."

This error appears in:
• Sermon illustrations (decades of use)
• Devotional materials (Harvest Ministries, others)
• Bible study resources

WHY IT'S WRONG:
• CHRONOLOGY: New Testament written 50-100 CE; dynamite invented
  1867 CE by Alfred Nobel - 1,800 year gap makes this impossible

• DIRECTION: Nobel BORROWED the Greek word "dunamis" (which already
  meant "power") to NAME his new invention. Modern word took name
  from ancient Greek, not vice versa.

• MEANING: First-century readers had ZERO concept of chemical
  explosives. They understood "ability" or "strength," not
  "explosive force."

Authority: D.A. Carson (Exegetical Fallacies), BDAG lexicon,
historical chronology

║ ✅ CORRECT TEACHING - SAY THIS INSTEAD                       ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

ACTUAL MEANING:
δύναμις (dunamis) = power, might, strength, ability, capability

From the verb δύναμαι (dunamai) meaning "to be able" or "to have
power."

TEACH IT THIS WAY:
"Dunamis emphasizes God's inherent ability and effective strength.
In Romans 1:16, Paul says the gospel is God's POWER - His effective
ability to accomplish salvation. It's not about explosive destruction,
but about sustained, transformative power that actually saves."

MEMORY AID:
Think "DYNAMIC" (energetic, active) - a related English word that
doesn't imply explosives. God's power is dynamic - active and effective,
not destructive.

Or remember: ABILITY + STRENGTH = God's dunamis to save

Error Type: Etymological Fallacy + Anachronism (reverse chronology)
Prevalence: EPIDEMIC - widespread in sermons for 50+ years
Sensitivity: LOW - easy to correct graciously

KEY VERSE: Romans 1:16 - "gospel is the power (dunamis) of God"

LEXICON SAYS: "Power, might, strength, force, capability; the
ability to perform" - BDAG

NT OCCURRENCES: 120 times (miracles, divine power, abilities)

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Congregation likely heard this: YES - extremely common sermon
illustration

If correcting from pulpit:
✅ DO SAY: "Many preachers have used the dynamite illustration -
it's memorable! But scholars note that dynamite was invented 1,800
years after Paul wrote Romans. The actual meaning is even better:
God's inherent, effective power to save."

✅ DO SAY: "I've heard this too, and it stuck with me! But let's
look at what dunamis really means..."

❌ DON'T SAY: "That old dynamite illustration is completely wrong."

❌ DON'T SAY: "Anyone who studied Greek knows this is false."

ALTERNATIVE ILLUSTRATION:
"Think of a dynamo - a power generator. God's dunamis is like a
generator that never runs out, continuously providing the power
needed for salvation."

Denominational sensitivity: Common across evangelical/charismatic
traditions. No particular tradition "owns" this error.

GRACIOUS CORRECTION PRINCIPLE:
Acknowledge WHY it's tempting (memorability, vivid imagery), THEN
correct with chronology, THEN provide better alternative.

Top 3 sources:
• D.A. Carson, "Exegetical Fallacies" (1984), Chapter 1 - Defines
  this as "semantic anachronism" - interpreting ancient Greek by
  modern English word

• BDAG Greek-English Lexicon - Entry for δύναμις: "power, might,
  strength, force, capability"

• Mark Drinnenberg (Scribal Cafe blog) - "What does a 19th century
  usage have to do with 1st century understanding? Absolutely
  nothing."

Historical note:
Alfred Nobel invented dynamite in 1867. He chose the Greek word
"dunamis" (power) to name his invention because scientists
typically use Greek/Latin for new discoveries. The word already
meant "power" - he didn't create a new meaning.

QUICK SUMMARY FOR BUSY PASTORS:

❌ DON'T: "Dunamis = dynamite" (chronologically impossible)
✅ DO: "Dunamis = inherent power/ability" (BDAG, from δύναμαι)
💡 TEACH: "God's effective, sustained power to save"
```
