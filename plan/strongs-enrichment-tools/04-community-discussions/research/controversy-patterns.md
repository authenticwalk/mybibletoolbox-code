# Controversy Patterns: Error Taxonomy for Biblical Word Studies

**Created:** 2025-11-12
**Purpose:** Systematically identify and classify common errors in community discussions about biblical words

---

## Overview

This document catalogs recurring error patterns found in Stack Exchange, forums, blogs, and community discussions about Strong's words. Each error type has:

1. **Definition** - What the error is
2. **Detection Patterns** - Language that signals this error
3. **Why It's Tempting** - Psychological/pedagogical reasons
4. **Classic Examples** - Well-documented cases
5. **Refutation Strategy** - How to find scholarly corrections

---

## Error Type 1: Etymological Fallacy

### Definition
False claims about word origins, derivations, or historical connections between words.

### Detection Patterns
- "X comes from Y" (without evidence)
- "The root word means..."
- "Originally meant..." (speculation)
- "Derived from..." (false connections)
- Chronologically impossible connections

### Why It's Tempting
- Etymology feels like unlocking "secret meaning"
- Word origins are memorable teaching tools
- Sounds scholarly without requiring expertise
- Creates "aha moments" in teaching

### Classic Examples

**G1411 δύναμις → "dynamite"**
- **Error:** "Dunamis is where we get dynamite, showing God's explosive power"
- **Truth:** Dynamite invented 1867 by Alfred Nobel; NT written 1st-2nd century CE
- **Chronology:** Impossible - NT predates dynamite by 1800+ years
- **Refutation:** Any Greek lexicon, historical timeline

**G1577 ἐκκλησία → "called out ones"**
- **Error:** "Ekklesia means 'called out ones' showing church is separate"
- **Truth:** Ekklesia = assembly/gathering (secular + religious usage)
- **Etymology vs. Meaning:** Root ek + kaleo ≠ established meaning
- **Refutation:** BDAG, Thayer's, LSJ all define as "assembly"

**H8478 תַּחַת taḥaṯ → "under authority"**
- **Error:** "Tachat always implies submission"
- **Truth:** Primarily spatial "under/beneath," contextually "in place of"
- **Over-specification:** Adding theological meaning to neutral preposition
- **Refutation:** BDB lexicon

### Refutation Strategy
1. Check chronology (word can't derive from something invented later)
2. Consult etymology section in BDAG, Thayer's, BDB, LSJ
3. Search: "{word} etymology fallacy" or "{word} does not mean {claimed origin}"
4. Check Tool 1 lexicon-core etymology section

---

## Error Type 2: Anachronism

### Definition
Importing modern word meanings, cultural concepts, or English etymology into ancient Greek/Hebrew.

### Detection Patterns
- "In English, X means..." (then applies to Greek/Hebrew)
- Modern cultural concepts projected backward
- 21st-century theology read into 1st-century words
- Systematic theology imposed on lexical semantics

### Why It's Tempting
- Modern meanings feel more relevant
- Easier to understand than ancient cultural context
- Supports desired theological conclusions
- English study Bibles sometimes perpetuate this

### Classic Examples

**G26 ἀγάπη → "unconditional love"**
- **Error:** "Agape means unconditional love unlike phileo"
- **Truth:** Agape in NT = love (often divine, sometimes conditional - see Rev 2:4 losing first love)
- **Anachronism:** "Unconditional" is modern theological category, not Greek lexical meaning
- **Nuance:** Agape CAN describe divine unconditional love, but word itself doesn't mean "unconditional"
- **Refutation:** BDAG notes range of usage, including conditional

**G3056 λόγος → "Jesus is the Logos"**
- **Error:** "Every use of logos refers to Christ"
- **Truth:** Logos = word, message, account, reason (context determines)
- **Anachronism:** John 1:1 theological use ≠ all 330 NT occurrences
- **Refutation:** Check any lexicon semantic range

**G5485 χάρις → "grace means unmerited favor"**
- **Error:** "Grace ALWAYS means unmerited favor"
- **Truth:** Grace = favor, kindness, gratitude, charm (context varies)
- **Systematic Theology:** Reformed definition imposed on all usages
- **Refutation:** BDAG lists 5+ sense categories

### Refutation Strategy
1. Check lexicon semantic range (words have multiple senses)
2. Distinguish theological usage from lexical meaning
3. Search: "{word} does not always mean {modern claim}"
4. Consult Tool 2 scholarly-analysis for diachronic shifts
5. Check classical usage in LSJ (was meaning already present?)

## Error Type 3: False Cognates / Sound-Alike Confusion

### Definition
Assuming words that sound similar are etymologically related or share meaning.

### Detection Patterns
- "Sounds like..." followed by connection
- Puns based on phonetic similarity
- Cross-language sound connections without linguistic evidence
- Homonym confusion (different words, same spelling/sound)

### Why It's Tempting
- Memorable teaching illustrations
- Creates wordplay and hooks
- Feels like discovering hidden connections
- Works in oral teaching (sound similarity impressive)

### Classic Examples

**Hebrew Wordplay (legitimate vs. false)**
- **Legitimate:** Genesis 2:7 אָדָם (adam) from אֲדָמָה (adamah) - man from ground (intentional biblical wordplay)
- **False:** Claiming every similar-sounding Hebrew word is related

**Greek Homonyms**
- **G3691 ὀξύς (oxys)** = sharp, swift
- **G3690 ὄξος (oxos)** = sour wine, vinegar
- **Error:** Connecting these because similar spelling
- **Truth:** Different roots, different meanings (homonyms)

**English Sound-Alikes**
- **Error:** "Phileo sounds like 'feel,' showing emotion-based love"
- **Truth:** Greek φιλέω has no connection to English "feel"
- **Absurdity:** English etymology irrelevant to Greek

### Refutation Strategy
1. Check etymology section in lexicons
2. Verify linguistic connection with scholarly source
3. Search: "{word1} {word2} related etymology"
4. Tool 1 etymology field shows actual derivations

---

## Error Type 4: Over-Specification

### Definition
Adding specific details, physical actions, or narrow meanings not actually in the word's semantic range.

### Detection Patterns
- Overly specific definitions
- Adding physical actions ("jumping" for joy)
- Imposing precise measurements or quantities
- Claiming word specifies what text doesn't

### Why It's Tempting
- Specific details are memorable
- Makes teaching more vivid and concrete
- Feels like going "deeper"
- Avoids abstraction

### Classic Examples

**G5479 χαρά → "jumping for joy"**
- **Error:** "Chara (joy) means literally jumping for joy"
- **Truth:** Joy, gladness, delight (no physical action inherent)
- **Over-specification:** Adding physical action not in word
- **Refutation:** BDAG defines as "state of gladness" (no jumping)

**G25 ἀγαπάω → "sacrificial action"**
- **Error:** "Agapao always means sacrificial action"
- **Truth:** To love, have affection for (range includes divine to human love)
- **Over-specification:** Not all agapao usage involves sacrifice
- **Refutation:** Check usage in contexts like "love money" (1 Tim 6:10) - not sacrificial

**H520 אַמָּה ammah → "cubit = 18 inches exactly"**
- **Error:** Claiming precise modern measurement
- **Truth:** Cubit varied by culture and time period (17.5-20.4 inches)
- **Over-specification:** Ancient measurements weren't standardized
- **Refutation:** Any Bible dictionary or measurement study

### Refutation Strategy
1. Check if lexicon includes claimed specificity
2. Look for counterexamples (word used in ways that contradict claim)
3. Search: "{word} does not mean {specific claim}"
4. Tool 1 semantic range shows actual breadth of meaning

---

## Error Type 5: Lexical Maximalism ("Word Study Fallacy")

### Definition
Claiming that ALL dictionary senses of a word apply simultaneously in every occurrence.

### Detection Patterns
- "Also means..." lists (stacking all definitions)
- "X encompasses all of these: A, B, C, D"
- "The full meaning includes..."
- Importing all semantic senses into single verse

### Why It's Tempting
- Seems to honor richness of biblical language
- Makes single verses feel more profound
- Avoids choosing one sense over another
- Creates theological depth appearance

### Classic Examples

**G3056 λόγος → "means all of: word, reason, discourse, divine speech, account, reckoning"**
- **Error:** Every occurrence carries all senses
- **Truth:** Context determines which sense applies
- **Word Study Fallacy:** Dictionary lists senses, not simultaneous meanings
- **Refutation:** D.A. Carson "Exegetical Fallacies" ch. 1

**G4151 πνεῦμα → "spirit, wind, breath all at once"**
- **Error:** Pneuma always contains wind + breath + spirit meanings
- **Truth:** One primary sense per context (though wordplay exists - John 3)
- **Legitimate Exception:** John 3:8 intentional double-meaning (wind/Spirit)
- **Refutation:** Context + syntax determine meaning

### Refutation Strategy
1. Check context to determine which sense applies
2. Lexicons list range, not simultaneous meanings
3. Search: "word study fallacy" or "illegitimate totality transfer"
4. Carson's "Exegetical Fallacies" documents this pattern
5. Tool 1 semantic range categories are alternatives, not additions

---

## Error Type 6: Theological Projection

### Definition
Reading systematic theology, doctrinal formulations, or later church tradition back into individual word meanings.

### Detection Patterns
- Finding Trinity in every plural verb
- Seeing systematic soteriology in single words
- Importing creeds into lexical semantics
- Denominational interpretation claimed as lexical meaning

### Why It's Tempting
- Supports doctrinal positions
- Makes theology feel biblical
- Unifies scattered biblical data
- Avoids complexity of biblical theology

### Classic Examples

**H430 אֱלֹהִים Elohim → "plural proves Trinity"**
- **Error:** Plural form of "God" proves Trinity doctrine
- **Truth:** Elohim = plural of majesty/intensity (common in Hebrew)
- **Theological Projection:** Later trinitarian theology imposed on Hebrew grammar
- **Nuance:** Trinity defensible biblically, but not from this grammatical form alone
- **Refutation:** BDB, Hebrew grammar (plural of majesty), Jewish interpretation

**G4991 σωτηρία → "salvation means justification + sanctification + glorification"**
- **Error:** Every NT use includes full ordo salutis
- **Truth:** Salvation = deliverance, rescue (context specifies from what)
- **Theological Projection:** Systematic theology imposed on word
- **Refutation:** BDAG lists range: deliverance, preservation, salvation

**G1577 ἐκκλησία → "church means invisible universal body"**
- **Error:** NT ekklesia always = invisible universal church
- **Truth:** Assembly, congregation (local or conceptual, context determines)
- **Theological Projection:** Later ecclesiology imposed
- **Refutation:** BDAG lists local assembly as primary NT sense

### Refutation Strategy
1. Distinguish lexical meaning from theological usage
2. Check historical development (when did theological sense emerge?)
3. Search: "{word} theology vs lexical meaning"
4. Tool 2 scholarly-analysis documents theological development
5. Tool 1 lexicon-core gives pre-theological semantic range

---

## Error Type 7: Selective Definition

### Definition
Choosing one sense from semantic range and claiming it's the ONLY meaning, ignoring other valid uses.

### Detection Patterns
- "X ALWAYS means Y" (when range is broader)
- "Never means Z" (when lexicons include Z)
- Ignoring counterexamples
- Cherry-picking one lexicon over others

### Classic Examples

**G5485 χάρις → "grace NEVER means physical beauty"**
- **Error:** Claiming grace only means divine favor
- **Truth:** Classical Greek includes physical charm/beauty (see LSJ)
- **Selective:** Ignoring classical/Koine range
- **Refutation:** LSJ, BDAG both list "favor, beauty, grace"

**G3056 λόγος → "logos NEVER means mathematical ratio"**
- **Error:** Ignoring classical philosophical usage
- **Truth:** Plato, Aristotle use logos = ratio, proportion
- **Selective:** NT range ≠ total Greek range
- **Refutation:** LSJ classical definitions, Liddell-Scott

### Refutation Strategy
1. Check FULL semantic range in multiple lexicons
2. Look for counterexamples in corpus
3. Distinguish NT usage from total Greek/Hebrew range
4. Tool 1 convergence/divergence notes range breadth

---

## Detection Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Potential Error
- Read community discussion
- Flag claims that:
  - Lack citations
  - Sound overly specific
  - Use detection pattern language
  - Contradict Tool 1 lexicon data

### Step 2: Classify Error Type
- Match against 7 error types above
- Assign classification
- Note if multiple types present

### Step 3: Verify It's Actually an Error
- Check Tool 1 lexicon-core
- Consult BDAG/Thayer's/BDB/LSJ
- Search scholarly sources
- **Caution:** Some "errors" are scholarly debates (not errors)

### Step 4: Find Refutation
- See `refutation-sources.md`
- Search patterns documented there
- Require HIGH or MEDIUM authority source
- Must include evidence, not just assertion

### Step 5: Document
- Follow schema structure
- Include error → refutation → evidence
- Classify error type
- Assess prevalence (widespread/moderate/uncommon)

---

## Prevalence Assessment

**Widespread:**
- Found in multiple forums/sites
- Repeated in blogs/teaching materials
- Common Google autocomplete result
- Appears in published resources

**Moderate:**
- Found in 2-3 locations
- Recurring question on Stack Exchange
- Mentioned in some teaching contexts

**Uncommon:**
- Single occurrence or rare
- Corrected quickly in community
- Not widely propagated

---

## Tone Guidelines

### Always:
- Be gracious (errors are human)
- Acknowledge why error is tempting
- Provide positive alternative framing
- Cite evidence, not just assertion

### Never:
- Mock community members
- Use dismissive language
- Assume malicious intent
- Present refutation without evidence

### Example Phrasing:
- ✅ "While this interpretation is common, lexicons show..."
- ✅ "This claim appears in several sources, but chronology indicates..."
- ✅ "Though tempting to connect these words, etymology reveals..."

- ❌ "This ridiculous claim..."
- ❌ "Anyone who studied Greek knows..."
- ❌ "Obviously wrong..."
