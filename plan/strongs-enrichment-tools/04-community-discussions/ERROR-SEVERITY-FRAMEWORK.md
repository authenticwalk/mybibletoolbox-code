# Error Severity Framework: Prioritization System

**Created:** 2025-11-12
**Purpose:** Rank errors by impact to prioritize production workflow

---

## Overview

Not all errors are equally harmful. This framework assesses error severity across two dimensions:
1. **Theological Impact** - How much damage does this error cause?
2. **Propagation Level** - How widely has it spread?

**Priority = Theological Impact × Propagation Level**

---

## Dimension 1: Theological Impact

### CRITICAL (Priority 1)
**Definition:** Affects core Christian doctrine or salvation understanding

**Characteristics:**
- Undermines essential doctrines (Trinity, deity of Christ, salvation, Scripture authority)
- Could lead to heresy if uncorrected
- Affects eternal matters
- Causes theological confusion at foundational level

**Examples:**
- *Potential:* Errors about deity of Christ, nature of salvation, authority of Scripture
- *Note:* Few word-study errors rise to this level (doctrines built on cumulative evidence)

**Production Priority:** Address immediately, human theological review required

---

### HIGH (Priority 2)
**Definition:** Affects church practice, identity, or secondary doctrines

**Characteristics:**
- Impacts how church functions or understands itself
- Affects important (non-essential) doctrines
- Influences practical ministry decisions
- Creates denominational confusion

**Examples:**
- G1577 ἐκκλησία → "called out ones" (affects church identity)
- Baptism-related errors (affects practice)
- Leadership/elder qualification errors (affects structure)
- H430 אֱלֹהִים → "plural proves Trinity" (weakens apologetics, though doctrine sound)

**Production Priority:** Address early in production phase

---

### MEDIUM (Priority 3)
**Definition:** Common teaching errors that mislead but don't damage core theology

**Characteristics:**
- Widespread in sermons/teaching
- Memorable but inaccurate
- Undermines confidence in biblical teaching when corrected
- Creates unnecessary confusion

**Examples:**
- G1411 δύναμις → "dynamite" (misleading but doesn't affect salvation theology)
- G5479 χαρά → "jumping for joy" (over-specification, not heretical)
- Etymology-based word studies generally

**Production Priority:** Address mid-production phase

---

### LOW (Priority 4)
**Definition:** Minor linguistic misunderstandings with limited impact

**Characteristics:**
- Rare occurrence
- Limited spread
- Easy to correct
- Doesn't affect theology or practice meaningfully
- Academic interest more than practical concern

**Examples:**
- Obscure word errors
- Technical grammar misunderstandings
- Rare hapax legomena over-interpretations

**Production Priority:** Address opportunistically or skip

---

## Dimension 2: Propagation Level

### EPIDEMIC (Multiplier: 4x)
**Definition:** Systematic teaching, published materials, widespread acceptance

**Characteristics:**
- Appears in published books, study Bibles, curricula
- Taught systematically in seminaries or Bible colleges
- Multiple denominations/movements affected
- Difficult to correct due to institutional entrenchment
- Google autocomplete suggests it
- Found in "respected" sources (not just fringe)

**Examples:**
- G1411 δύναμις → "dynamite" (decades of sermon literature, devotional books)
- G1577 ἐκκλησία → "called out ones" (systematic church teaching)

**Indicators:**
- 10+ published books mentioning
- Seminary course materials include it
- Study Bible notes perpetuate it
- Major ministry websites teach it

**Impact:** Requires sustained correction effort across multiple channels

---

### WIDESPREAD (Multiplier: 3x)
**Definition:** Common in multiple churches/ministries but not yet systematic

**Characteristics:**
- Found in sermons across multiple churches
- Popular on Christian blogs/websites
- Facebook/social media shares
- Common in Bible study groups
- Not yet in formal curricula but gaining traction

**Examples:**
- H430 אֱלֹהִים → "plural proves Trinity" (common apologetics argument)
- Various etymology-based teachings spreading virally

**Indicators:**
- 5-10 churches/ministries teaching
- Popular blog posts (100+ shares)
- Appears in sermon series
- Reddit/Stack Exchange questions

**Impact:** Catching it before epidemic stage critical

---

### MODERATE (Multiplier: 2x)
**Definition:** Occasional occurrence, limited geographic/denominational spread

**Characteristics:**
- Found in specific regions or traditions
- 2-4 sources teaching it
- Not widely known outside specific circles
- Early-stage spread

**Examples:**
- Regional teaching peculiarities
- Denomination-specific interpretations
- Pastor-specific teachings starting to spread

**Indicators:**
- 2-4 documented occurrences
- Limited to specific denomination/region
- Not yet viral
- Stack Exchange has 1-2 questions

**Impact:** Preventable if addressed now

---

### ISOLATED (Multiplier: 1x)
**Definition:** Rare occurrence, single source or minimal spread

**Characteristics:**
- One pastor/teacher promoting
- Single blog post or sermon
- Hasn't spread beyond origin
- May be one-off mistake

**Examples:**
- Novel interpretations not gaining traction
- Individual creative (but wrong) teachings
- Mistakes corrected quickly in comments

**Indicators:**
- Single source
- No repeat occurrences
- Community self-corrected
- Not spreading

**Impact:** Monitor but low priority

---

## Priority Matrix

### Formula
**Priority Score = Theological Impact × Propagation Multiplier**

| Theological Impact | Epidemic (4x) | Widespread (3x) | Moderate (2x) | Isolated (1x) |
|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **CRITICAL**      | **P1: 16**    | **P1: 12**      | **P2: 8**     | **P3: 4**     |
| **HIGH**          | **P1: 12**    | **P2: 9**       | **P3: 6**     | **P4: 3**     |
| **MEDIUM**        | **P2: 8**     | **P3: 6**       | **P4: 4**     | **P5: 2**     |
| **LOW**           | **P3: 4**     | **P4: 3**       | **P5: 2**     | **P6: 1**     |

### Priority Bands

**P1 (Score 12-16): IMMEDIATE**
- Production starts here
- Human theological review
- Multiple format corrections (card, article, video)
- Proactive outreach to perpetuating sources

**P2 (Score 8-9): HIGH**
- First 100 words in production
- Standard correction approach
- Quick reference cards
- Seminary/pastor notification

**P3 (Score 4-7): MEDIUM**
- Words 101-300 in production
- Standard approach
- Online documentation sufficient

**P4-P6 (Score 1-3): LOW**
- Words 301-500 or opportunistic
- Document when encountered
- No proactive research needed

## Application Examples

### Example 1: G1411 δύναμις → "dynamite"
**Theological Impact:** MEDIUM (misleading but not heretical)
**Propagation:** EPIDEMIC (decades of materials, Harvest Ministries, systematic)
**Score:** 3 × 4 = **12 (P1: IMMEDIATE)**
**Rationale:** Not theologically damaging but SO widespread it undermines biblical teaching credibility

---

### Example 2: G1577 ἐκκλησία → "called out ones"
**Theological Impact:** HIGH (affects church identity and self-understanding)
**Propagation:** EPIDEMIC (systematic church teaching, sermon series, curricula)
**Score:** 3 × 4 = **12 (P1: IMMEDIATE)**
**Rationale:** Affects how churches understand their nature and mission

---

### Example 3: H430 אֱלֹהִים → "plural proves Trinity"
**Theological Impact:** HIGH (weakens apologetics; Trinity doctrine sound but argument weak)
**Propagation:** WIDESPREAD (common apologetics, not systematic curriculum)
**Score:** 3 × 3 = **9 (P2: HIGH)**
**Rationale:** Sensitive doctrine but not epidemic; needs correction but less urgent

---

### Example 4: G5479 χαρά → "jumping for joy"
**Theological Impact:** MEDIUM (over-specification, misleading but minor)
**Propagation:** MODERATE (some sermons, not systematic)
**Score:** 2 × 2 = **4 (P3: MEDIUM)**
**Rationale:** Worth correcting but not urgent

---
