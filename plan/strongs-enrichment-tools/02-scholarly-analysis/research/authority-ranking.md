# Authority Ranking System for Scholarly Sources

**Created:** 2025-11-11
**Purpose:** Classification system for ranking scholarly source authority in Strong's enrichment

---

## Overview

Not all scholarly sources have equal authority. This document provides a systematic ranking system to ensure Tool 2 (scholarly-analysis) maintains HIGH authority standards while Tool 3 (web-insights) handles MEDIUM authority sources appropriately.

**Key Principle:** Tool 2 focuses exclusively on peer-reviewed and academically equivalent sources (HIGH authority).

## Expected Authority Distribution

### Tool 2 Target Distribution

**Ideal for Theological Word:**
- Tier 1 (HIGHEST): 50-70% of sources
- Tier 2 (HIGH): 30-50% of sources
- Tier 3-6: 0% (save for other tools)

**Example for G26 ἀγάπη:**
- Expect 5-10 Tier 1 sources (JBL, NTS, academic monographs)
- Expect 3-5 Tier 2 sources (SBL papers, PhD dissertations)
- Total: 8-15 scholarly sources

**Example for G3056 λόγος:**
- Expect 10-15 Tier 1 sources (highly studied word)
- Expect 5-10 Tier 2 sources
- Total: 15-25 scholarly sources (abundant scholarship)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test on G26 ἀγάπη** - Verify Tier 1-2 sources are findable
2. **Test on G3056 λόγος** - Check scholarly debate representation
3. **Document authority distribution** - Track what tier sources are most valuable
4. **Refine criteria** - Adjust based on experiment learnings
5. **Create verification templates** - Streamline authority checking
