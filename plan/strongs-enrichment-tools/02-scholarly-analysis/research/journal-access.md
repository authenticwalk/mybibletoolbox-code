## Practical Workflow

### For Each Strong's Word

1. **Start with Google Scholar**
   - Search "{transliteration}" OR "Strong's {number}"
   - Filter by open access
   - Check first 3 pages of results

2. **Search .edu Sites**
   - `site:.edu "{transliteration} biblical"`
   - `site:.edu "Strong's {number}"`
   - Review top 20 results

3. **Check Cross-Reference Codes**
   - If Tool 1 found BDAG/TDNT codes, search those
   - `"BDAG {code}"` often finds more results
   - Academic papers cite these systems

4. **Seminary Websites**
   - Search specific seminary sites
   - Look for faculty publications
   - Check thesis repositories

5. **Verify Quality**
   - Check author credentials
   - Verify peer-review status
   - Add to ATTRIBUTION.md

6. **Extract & Cite**
   - Quote insights in context
   - Use inline citations `{source-id}`
   - Mark authority level

---

## Common Pitfalls

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Paywalled content (don't attempt to circumvent)
- ❌ Non-peer-reviewed blogs (save for Tool 3)
- ❌ Wikipedia (use its citations, not Wikipedia itself)
- ❌ Study Bible notes (copyrighted, not scholarly)
- ❌ Sermon manuscripts (not peer-reviewed)

**Prefer:**
- ✅ Open-access journal articles
- ✅ Seminary ETDs
- ✅ Faculty publications
- ✅ Conference papers
- ✅ Monograph previews

---

## Expected Success Rate

Based on Tool 1 learnings and theological significance:

**High-Frequency Theological Words (love, grace, faith):**
- Expected: 10-20 scholarly sources available
- Reality: Usually abundant scholarship

**Medium-Frequency Theological Words:**
- Expected: 5-10 scholarly sources
- Reality: Adequate coverage

**Rare Theological Words:**
- Expected: 2-5 scholarly sources
- Reality: May need to rely more on lexicons (Tool 1)

**Grammatical Words:**
- Expected: Limited theological scholarship
- Reality: Tool 1 (lexicon-core) is primary source; Tool 2 adds little value

---

## Next Steps

1. Test on G26 ἀγάπη (expect abundant sources)
2. Test on G3056 λόγος (expect theological debates)
3. Document what works, what doesn't
4. Refine search strategies based on learnings
5. Create search pattern templates for common scenarios
