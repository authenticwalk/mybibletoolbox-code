# Error Correction Template - Tool 3 (Web Insights)
# Based on Experiment 4 (G1411 dynamis - dynamite fallacy)
# 5-Part Structure: Error → Classification → Refutation → Validation → Alternative

error_id: 1
error_type: "etymological_fallacy"  # or semantic_anachronism, totality_transfer, etc.
common_claim: "[Quote the specific error claim]"
prevalence: "moderate"  # widespread | moderate | uncommon

sources_of_error:
  - "[Where this error comes from - e.g., popular teaching, outdated commentary]"
  - "[Additional source if applicable]"

# ============================================================================
# PART 1: Error Statement (clear, non-mocking)
# ============================================================================
# Purpose: State the error clearly without condescension
# Tone: Gracious, pedagogical
# Example: "Common claim: Because dynamis shares roots with 'dynamite',
#          the word means explosive power {spurious-source}"

error_statement: |
  [Clear statement of the error with citation if possible]

# ============================================================================
# PART 2: Classification (name the fallacy type)
# ============================================================================
# Purpose: Educate about the type of error, using scholarly terminology
# Examples: semantic_anachronism (Carson), reverse_etymological_fallacy (Cara)

fallacy_classification:
  primary_type: "etymological_fallacy"
  alternative_names:
    - "[Scholar's term for this error type]"
    - "[Another scholar's term if different]"
  definition: "[Brief definition of the fallacy type]"

# ============================================================================
# PART 3: Multi-Layered Refutation (4-5 evidence types)
# ============================================================================
# Purpose: Build comprehensive case against error using multiple evidence types
# Minimum: 4 types of evidence
# Examples: linguistic, diachronic, contextual, scholarly consensus, mathematical

refutation:
  evidence_1_linguistic: |
    [Linguistic evidence against the error - e.g., word formation patterns,
    semantic analysis, usage patterns in corpus]
    {source}

  evidence_2_diachronic: |
    [Historical/chronological evidence - e.g., word X came after word Y,
    semantic shift over time, etymology actually goes opposite direction]
    {source}

  evidence_3_contextual: |
    [Contextual evidence from NT usage - e.g., word used in ways incompatible
    with claimed meaning in specific verses, semantic range analysis]
    {source}

  evidence_4_scholarly_consensus: |
    [Major lexicons and scholarly consensus - e.g., BDAG, LSJ, Thayer all
    agree on proper understanding, standard references refute error]
    {source}

  evidence_5_additional: |
    [Optional 5th evidence type if available - e.g., mathematical (date ranges),
    comparative (other languages), cultural/historical context]
    {source}

# ============================================================================
# PART 4: Expert Validation (stack authorities - pyramid structure)
# ============================================================================
# Purpose: Show expert consensus on the correction
# Minimum: 2 sources (MEDIUM-HIGH+), at least 1 HIGH or VERY HIGH preferred
# Structure: Pyramid - top scholars first, build down to broader support

expert_validation:
  very_high_authority:
    - author: "[Name]"
      credentials: "[Ph.D., institutional position, publications]"
      quote: "[Direct quote or paraphrase of their correction]"
      authority_level: "VERY HIGH"
      authority_note: "[Why VERY HIGH - e.g., leading scholar, peer-reviewed monograph author]"
      source_url: "[URL]"
      verification_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"

  high_authority:
    - author: "[Name]"
      credentials: "[Ph.D., relevant field]"
      quote: "[Their correction or insight]"
      authority_level: "HIGH"
      authority_note: "[Why HIGH - e.g., published scholar, respected expert]"
      source_url: "[URL]"
      verification_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"

  medium_authority:
    - author: "[Name]"
      credentials: "[Ph.D. or Th.D., teaching position]"
      quote: "[Their correction]"
      authority_level: "MEDIUM"
      authority_note: "[Why MEDIUM - e.g., expert blog, not peer-reviewed]"
      source_url: "[URL]"
      verification_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"

# ============================================================================
# PART 5: Correct Alternative (teach proper methodology)
# ============================================================================
# Purpose: Build up correct understanding, not just tear down error
# Components: Principle + Methodology + Better Analogy + Biblical Usage

correct_alternative:
  principle: "[Core principle - e.g., 'Context determines meaning, not etymology']"

  methodology: |
    [Step-by-step proper methodology to avoid this error type]
    1. [First step]
    2. [Second step]
    3. [Third step]
    4. [Fourth step]

  better_analogy: |
    [Memorable alternative that illustrates correct understanding]
    Example: "Word meanings evolve like 'nice' (foolish → pleasant),
    etymology doesn't lock meaning"
    Example: "Think 'dynamo' (continuous power) not 'dynamite' (explosive)"

  biblical_usage_pattern: |
    [How the word actually functions in NT context]
    In NT, word appears in [X contexts] with [Y semantic range] showing
    [Z pattern] {concordance-source}

# ============================================================================

# Notes for Researchers
# ============================================================================

researcher_notes: |
  TONE GUIDELINES:
  - Acknowledge error is widespread (don't mock those who believe it)
  - Use "common claim" not "stupid idea"
  - Explain WHY wrong, not just THAT wrong
  - Teach methodology to avoid similar errors
  - Build up correct understanding positively

  QUALITY STANDARDS:
  - At least 2 sources (MEDIUM-HIGH+)
  - At least 1 HIGH or VERY HIGH authority
  - At least 4 evidence types
  - Gracious, pedagogical tone throughout

  EXAMPLES TO STUDY:
  - See experiments/exp4-error-correction/G1411-synthesis.md
  - Dynamis/dynamite fallacy correction as model
  - Note how Carson, Cara, Mounce all cited
  - Note gracious tone: "very, very dangerous" not "idiotic"
