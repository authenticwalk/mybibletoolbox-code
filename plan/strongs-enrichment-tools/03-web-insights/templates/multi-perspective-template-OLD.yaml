# Bias Detection Validation (from Experiment 5)
# ============================================================================
# Purpose: Ensure fair presentation of all positions

  FAIRNESS PRINCIPLES:
  - Present ALL major positions with equal respect
  - Provide strongest arguments for each (not strawman versions)
  - Acknowledge where evidence supports each view
  - Don't impose single "correct" answer
  - Cultural sensitivity is crucial

  BIAS DETECTION:
  - Reversal Test: Could you flip order without changing implications?
  - Respect Test: Would advocates feel fairly represented?
  - Evidence Test: Did you present strongest case for all sides?

  TONE GUIDELINES:
  - Charitable engagement with all views
  - Professional navigation of controversy
  - Acknowledge legitimacy of different perspectives
  - Avoid: "Obviously X is wrong", "Clearly Y is right"
  - Use: "Position X argues...", "Position Y emphasizes..."

  TRANSLATOR GUIDANCE:
  - Decision framework, NOT answer sheet
  - Options, NOT mandates
  - Contextual factors to consider
  - Trust translator's judgment with local context

  QUALITY STANDARDS:
  - Minimum 2 positions documented
  - All advocates credentialed
  - All bias tests passed
  - Fair, charitable tone throughout

  EXAMPLES TO STUDY:
  - Exp 1: experiments/exp1-scholarly-disagreement/G4151-findings.md (pneuma)
  - Exp 5: experiments/exp5-cultural-debate/G1577-guidance-synthesis.md (ekklesia)
  - Note multi-perspective framework in action
  - Note how bias detection catches unfairness
