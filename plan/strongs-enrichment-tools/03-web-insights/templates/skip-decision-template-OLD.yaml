skip_reason: "grammatical_particle"  # Choose one:
# - grammatical_particle (no semantic content)
# - function_word (purely functional, no lexical meaning)
# - insufficient_coverage (no expert web sources found)
# - tool_1_sufficient (lexicon data is complete, no practical insights available)

# ============================================================================
# Skip Rationale (detailed explanation)
# ============================================================================

skip_rationale: |
  [Detailed explanation of why this word is being skipped]

  Example for grammatical particle:
  "δέ is a purely grammatical particle (conjunction/adversative) with no
  semantic content. All web sources found discuss grammatical function
  (sentence connection, contrast marking) rather than practical application
  or modern insights. This content belongs in Tool 1 (lexicon-core) as
  technical grammar documentation. Tool 3 adds zero value for function words."

  Example for insufficient coverage:
  "Despite exhaustive search across 10+ queries and multiple disciplines
  (Bible study platforms, linguistics, theology, translation resources),
  found only 1 source with minimal content. Insufficient expert coverage
  for credible Tool 3 entry. This word may benefit from specialized academic
  research (Tool 2) but lacks accessible web commentary."

  Example for tool_1_sufficient:
  "Lexicon data in Tool 1 fully covers this word's usage and meaning.
  Web search found no modern debates, no common errors to correct, no
  specialized translator guidance, and no practical insights beyond
  standard lexicon content. Tool 3 would merely duplicate Tool 1."

scope_boundary_analysis:
  # Tool 1 vs Tool 3 territory
  belongs_in_tool_1: true  # true | false
  tool_1_rationale: |
    [Why this belongs in Tool 1 if true]
    Example: "Grammatical particles are lexicon territory. Tool 1 should
    document function, usage patterns, and technical grammar. Tool 3 focuses
    on practical insights, modern debates, and translator guidance - none
    of which apply to function words."

  tool_3_adds_value: false  # true | false
  tool_3_value_assessment: |
    [Explain what value Tool 3 would/wouldn't add]
    Example: "Tool 3 could not add value beyond Tool 1 lexicon data.
    No modern debates, no error corrections needed, no translator-specific
    guidance beyond 'it's a conjunction'. Forcing Tool 3 entry would
    merely duplicate Tool 1 content."

# Word Category Analysis
# ============================================================================

word_category:
  # What type of word is this?
  part_of_speech: "conjunction"  # or particle, preposition, article, etc.
  semantic_content: false  # true | false - does word carry meaning or just function?
  lexical_meaning: false  # true | false - does word have lexical entry or just grammar?

  # Function vs Content
  function_word: true  # true | false
  content_word: false  # true | false

  # If function word, what function?
  grammatical_function: "adversative_conjunction"
  function_description: |
    [Describe the grammatical function]
    Example: "Connects clauses with adversative/contrastive sense ('but', 'and').
    Purely grammatical connector with no semantic content."

    [Why this skip demonstrates good judgment]
    Example: "Recognizing scope boundaries and appropriately skipping
    function words demonstrates system integrity. Not every word needs
    Tool 3 coverage. Skip decision = SUCCESS."

researcher_notes: |
  SKIP DECISION PHILOSOPHY:
  - Skip is SUCCESS, not failure
  - Demonstrates appropriate scope boundaries
  - Shows system integrity (not forcing coverage)
  - Honest assessment over completionism

  WHEN TO SKIP:
  1. Grammatical particles (δέ, γάρ, etc.)
  2. Function words with no semantic content
  3. Words with insufficient expert web coverage (after exhaustive search)
  4. Words where Tool 1 is sufficient (no practical insights beyond lexicon)

  WHEN NOT TO SKIP:
  1. Rare words with specialized coverage (see Exp 2 - eutrapelia in virtue ethics)
  2. Words with common errors to correct
  3. Words with translator-specific challenges
  4. Words with modern debates or cultural sensitivities

  EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH REQUIRED:
  - Minimum 5 queries for insufficient_coverage skip
  - Check multiple disciplines
  - Document all searches performed
  - Prove insufficient, not just inconvenient

  SCOPE BOUNDARY CLARITY:
  - Tool 1: Grammar, lexicon, technical linguistics
  - Tool 3: Practical insights, modern debates, error corrections, translator guidance
  - If unsure, err toward inclusion and document why

  EXAMPLES TO STUDY:
  - Exp 3: experiments/exp3-scope-boundary/G1161-boundary-assessment.md
  - See how δέ was correctly identified as outside Tool 3 scope
  - Note documentation of search effort
  - Note scope boundary reasoning

  QUALITY STANDARD:
  - Document search effort thoroughly
  - Provide clear rationale
  - Reference scope boundary criteria
  - Appropriate skip = demonstrates good judgment
