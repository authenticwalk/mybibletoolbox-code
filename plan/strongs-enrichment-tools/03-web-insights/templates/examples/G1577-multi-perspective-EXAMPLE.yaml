# === POSITIONS ===
positions:
  - position_id: 1
    view_name: "Traditional: 'church'"
    advocates:
      - name: "Multiple translation committees"
        credentials: "NIV, ESV, NASB translation teams"
        authority_level: "MEDIUM-HIGH"

    key_arguments:
      - "Established tradition: 'church' used consistently for 400+ years in English Bibles {kjv-tradition}"
      - "Theological continuity: Connects NT community with historical Christian ecclesiology {systematic-theology}"
      - "Covenantal identity: Emphasizes continuity with Israel as God's assembled people {biblical-theology}"

    strengths:
      - "Preserves theological depth and historical connection"
      - "Widely understood by English speakers as Christian gathering"

    considerations:
      - "May imply building rather than people in modern usage"
      - "Potential colonial overtones in some post-colonial contexts"

  - position_id: 2
    view_name: "Reformist: 'assembly'"
    advocates:
      - name: "House church movement advocates"
        credentials: "Translation practitioners, missiology scholars"
        authority_level: "MEDIUM"

    key_arguments:
      - "Semantic accuracy: Greek ἐκκλησία means 'assembly, gathering' - civic term, not religious {bdag}"
      - "Avoids building confusion: Modern 'church' often means building, not people {missiological-concern}"
      - "Cultural sensitivity: 'Church' carries institutional/colonial baggage in some contexts {post-colonial-critique}"

    strengths:
      - "Closer to Greek semantic range"
      - "Avoids building-centric misunderstanding"
      - "Culturally sensitive in post-colonial contexts"

    considerations:
      - "Loses theological richness and historical continuity"
      - "Less familiar to English readers accustomed to 'church'"
