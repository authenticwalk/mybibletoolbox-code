# EXAMPLE: Error Correction Template - G1411 δύναμις (dynamis)
# Based on Experiment 4 (exp4-error-correction/)
# Demonstrates proper use of error-correction.yaml template

error_id: 1
error_type: "etymological_fallacy"
common_claim: "Because δύναμις shares roots with English 'dynamite', it means explosive power"
prevalence: "moderate"

sources_of_error:
  - "Popular preaching"
  - "Etymology-based word studies"

# === PART 1: Error Statement ===
error_statement: |
  Common claim: "The Greek word δύναμις (dynamis) is where we get our English word 'dynamite',
  therefore it means explosive, earth-shattering power." {popular-teaching}

# === PART 2: Classification ===
fallacy_classification:
  primary_type: "etymological_fallacy"
  alternative_names:
    - "semantic_anachronism" # D.A. Carson's term
    - "reverse_etymological_fallacy"  # Robert Cara's term
  definition: "Assuming English etymology determines Greek meaning, ignoring chronological impossibility"

# === PART 3: Multi-Layered Refutation ===
refutation:
  evidence_1_linguistic: |
    English "dynamite" was coined by Alfred Nobel in 1867 from Greek dynamis. The Greek
    word existed 1800+ years earlier and cannot be defined by a modern English derivative. {carson-exegetical-fallacies}

  evidence_2_diachronic: |
    Chronological impossibility: NT written ~50-90 AD, dynamite invented 1867 AD.
    Word cannot mean what didn't exist for another 1800 years. {cara-cracking-ot-code}

  evidence_3_contextual: |
    NT usage shows δύναμις means "power, ability, strength" in contexts incompatible with
    "explosive": healing power (Luke 5:17), inherent ability (Matt 25:15), divine power (Rom 1:16).
    No "explosion" connotation in any NT occurrence. {mounce-blog}

  evidence_4_scholarly_consensus: |
    BDAG defines as "power, might, strength, force, capability" with no "explosive" sense.
    LSJ (classical Greek lexicon) shows continuous meaning from classical through Koine periods
    as "power, ability". {bdag} {lsj}

# === PART 5: Correct Alternative ===
correct_alternative:
  principle: "Meaning is determined by usage in historical context, not by modern derivatives"

  methodology: |
    1. Check NT usage patterns (not English etymology)
    2. Consult historical lexicons (BDAG for Koine period)
    3. Analyze immediate context of each occurrence
    4. Note chronology: Greek word precedes English derivative by 1800+ years

  better_analogy: "Think 'dynamo' (continuous power source) not 'dynamite' (explosive). Better yet, just use NT evidence: healing power, divine ability, inherent strength."

  biblical_usage_pattern: |
    NT uses δύναμις 120 times meaning: divine power (Rom 1:16), miracle-working ability
    (Mark 6:5), inherent strength/capability (Matt 25:15), healing power (Luke 5:17).
    Consistent meaning: power, ability, strength - never "explosion". {concordance-data}
