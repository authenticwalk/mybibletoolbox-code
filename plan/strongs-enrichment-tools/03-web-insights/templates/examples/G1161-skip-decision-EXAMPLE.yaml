# === SKIP REASON ===

# === SKIP RATIONALE ===
skip_rationale: |
  δέ is a purely grammatical particle (conjunction/adversative) with no semantic content.
  It functions to connect clauses with adversative ("but"), continuative ("and"), or
  transitional ("now") force, but carries no lexical meaning beyond grammatical function.

  All web sources found discuss grammatical function (sentence connection, contrast marking,
  discourse structure) rather than practical application or modern insights. This content
  belongs in Tool 1 (lexicon-core) as technical grammar documentation.

  Tool 3 is designed for practical insights, modern debates, error corrections, and
  translator guidance - none of which apply to function words. Including δέ would merely
  duplicate Tool 1 grammatical information without adding value.

# === SCOPE BOUNDARY ANALYSIS ===
scope_boundary_analysis:
  belongs_in_tool_1: true
  tool_1_rationale: |
    Grammatical particles are lexicon territory. Tool 1 (lexicon-core) should document:
    - Grammatical function (conjunction, adversative, transitional)
    - Usage patterns in different discourse contexts
    - Technical linguistic analysis

    This is precisely what lexicons are designed for.

  tool_3_adds_value: false
  tool_3_value_assessment: |
    Tool 3 could not add value beyond Tool 1 lexicon data. No modern debates exist about δέ,
    no error corrections needed, no translator-specific guidance beyond "it's a conjunction."

    Forcing a Tool 3 entry would merely duplicate Tool 1 grammatical content, violating the
    principle that "Tool 3 supplements (not duplicates) Tool 1."
