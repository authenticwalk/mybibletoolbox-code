# MINIMAL Skip Decision Template - Tool 3 (Web Insights)
# For documenting when/why a word is excluded from Tool 3
# See templates/GUIDE.md for detailed instructions and examples

# === METADATA ===
strongs_number: "G####"  # or H#### for Hebrew
language: "greek"  # or hebrew
lemma: "[Greek/Hebrew word]"
transliteration: "[Transliteration]"
gloss: "[Basic gloss]"

skip_decision:
  skipped: true
  skip_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  researcher: "[Name or agent ID]"

# === SKIP REASON ===
skip_reason: "grammatical_particle"  # Choose one:
# - grammatical_particle (no semantic content)
# - function_word (purely functional, no lexical meaning)
# - insufficient_coverage (no expert web sources found after exhaustive search)
# - tool_1_sufficient (lexicon data complete, no practical insights available)

# === SKIP RATIONALE (Detailed Explanation) ===
skip_rationale: |
  [Explain WHY this word is being skipped]

  Example for particles:
  "δέ is a grammatical particle with no semantic content. All sources discuss
  function, not practical application. Belongs in Tool 1 (lexicon-core)."

  Example for insufficient coverage:
  "Despite exhaustive search (10+ queries, multiple disciplines), found only 1
  source with minimal content. Insufficient expert coverage for Tool 3 entry."

# === SEARCH DOCUMENTATION (Prove exhaustive search if insufficient_coverage) ===
search_documentation:
  queries_executed:
    - query: "[Search query 1]"
      platform: "WebSearch"
      results: "[Minimal/none relevant]"
      date: "YYYY-MM-DD"

    - query: "[Search query 2]"
      platform: "WebSearch"
      results: "[Only grammatical discussion]"
      date: "YYYY-MM-DD"

  disciplines_searched:
    - "Bible study platforms"
    - "Linguistic analysis sites"
    - "Translation resources"
    - "Theological sources"

  total_queries: 10  # Minimum 5 for insufficient_coverage skip
  relevant_sources_found: 0

# === SCOPE BOUNDARY ANALYSIS ===
scope_boundary_analysis:
  belongs_in_tool_1: true  # Tool 1 vs Tool 3 territory
  tool_1_rationale: |
    [Why this belongs in Tool 1]
    Example: "Grammatical particles are lexicon territory. Tool 3 focuses on
    practical insights, modern debates, error corrections - none apply here."

  tool_3_adds_value: false
  tool_3_value_assessment: |
    [What value Tool 3 would/wouldn't add]

# === VALIDATION ===
validation:
  exhaustive_search_completed: true  # If insufficient_coverage
  scope_boundaries_respected: true
  tool_1_checked: true  # Verified Tool 1 covers this
  no_valuable_insights_found: true
  skip_is_success: true  # Appropriate skip = SUCCESS

# === RECOMMENDATIONS ===
recommendations:
  recommend_tool_1_coverage: true  # Should Tool 1 cover this?
  tool_1_scope: "grammatical_function"  # What should Tool 1 include?
  recommend_future_review: false  # Check again later if web coverage grows?
