# Experiment 4: Translator-Focused Word

**Strong's Number:** H7950
**Lemma:** שֶׁלֶג (sheleg)
**Gloss:** "snow"
**Occurrences:** 20 times in OT

---

## Purpose

Test Tool 3's ability to extract practical translator guidance for cultural translation challenges. "Snow" is a classic example: how do tropical/desert cultures without snow translate this word, especially in theological metaphors (Isaiah 1:18 "white as snow")?

**What We're Testing:**
- Can we find SIL/Wycliffe translator notes on cultural challenges?
- Are practical solutions documented (not just "it's hard")?
- Do sources show field-tested strategies?
- Is authority level appropriate for practical guidance?
- Does Tool 3 effectively serve Bible translators?

---

## The Translation Challenge

**Problem:**
- Many cultures have never experienced snow
- Direct translation impossible (no word exists)
- Theological stakes HIGH: Isaiah 1:18 "white as snow" = purity metaphor
- Cannot simply omit or change without losing meaning

**Cultural Contexts:**
- **Tropical:** Hawaiian, Pacific islands, equatorial Africa/Asia
- **Desert:** Saharan regions, Arabian peninsula
- **Arctic (inverse):** Have snow but may lack other biblical concepts (lamb, camel)

**Translation Questions:**
- Descriptive ("frozen rain from sky")?
- Substitute similar concept ("ice", "frost", "hail")?
- Borrow word + footnote?
- Focus on whiteness vs. coldness?

## Search Strategy

### Phase 1: Find Translator-Specific Content
```
WebSearch queries:
1. "snow" translation tropical cultures site:sil.org
2. "sheleg" Hebrew translation challenge
3. "snow" Isaiah 1:18 translation site:unfoldingword.org
4. "cultural translation" snow "no word for"
5. "Bible translation" snow tropical OR desert
6. "H7950 sheleg" translation notes
```

### Phase 2: Find Specific Solutions
```
WebSearch queries:
7. "Hawaiian Bible" snow translation
8. "Tok Pisin" snow "Isaiah 1:18"
9. "Arabic Bible" snow (desert context)
10. Translation consultant blog snow OR cultural adaptation
```

### Phase 3: Content Extraction
For each source:
1. Extract: specific translation challenges
2. Extract: documented solutions (language examples)
3. Extract: evaluation (what worked, what didn't)
4. Extract: translator guidance (prescriptive advice)
5. Verify: field experience, not just speculation

### Practical Applications (PRIMARY FOCUS)

**For Translators:**

**Challenge Documentation:**
```yaml
for_translators:
  - application_id: 1
    challenge: "Target language has no snow, never experienced"
    affected_cultures: ["Tropical", "Desert", "Equatorial"]
    theological_stakes: "HIGH - purity metaphor (Isaiah 1:18, Psalm 51:7)"
```

**Documented Solutions:**
```yaml
    solutions_documented:
      - language: "haw"  # Hawaiian
        translation: "hau kilihune" (fine frost/ice)
        strategy: "nearest_equivalent"
        evaluation: "Preserves whiteness, coldness; understood with footnote"
        source: {sil-case-study}

      - language: "tpi"  # Tok Pisin
        translation: "ais bilong ren" (ice belonging to rain)
        strategy: "descriptive_phrase"
        evaluation: "Clear description, theologically accurate"
        source: {wycliffe-notes}

      - language: "ara-saharan"  # Saharan Arabic dialects
        translation: "frozen rain from sky"
        strategy: "descriptive"
        evaluation: "Preserves whiteness metaphor with explanation"
        source: {bible-translation-magazine}
```

**Translator Guidance:**
```yaml
    guidance:
      - principle: "Focus on WHITENESS for purity metaphors, not coldness"
      - principle: "Find local metaphor for 'absolutely pure/clean' as alternative"
      - principle: "Footnote acceptable: 'white frozen precipitation from sky'"
      - principle: "Test with community: does solution convey purity?"
      - principle: "Consistency: use same solution across all snow references"
    evidence_type: "field_experience"
    authority_note: "HIGH for practical applications - field-tested solutions"
```

### Modern Insights (Secondary)

**Linguistic/Cultural Analysis:**
- Snow in Hebrew poetry: metaphor patterns
- Cultural background: snow in Israel (rare but known in mountains)
- LXX translation choices: Greek had word for snow
- NT references to snow: Revelation 1:14 "white as snow"

**Theological Significance:**
- Purity/cleansing imagery
- Divine transcendence (Job 38:22 "storehouses of snow")
- Transformation (Job 6:16 "hidden by snow")

### Teaching Helps (Tertiary)

**For Translation Teachers:**
- Case study: snow as example of cultural adaptation
- Methodology: descriptive vs. substitution strategies
- Evaluation criteria: theological accuracy vs. natural expression

## Validation Criteria

### Level 1: CRITICAL (Must Pass)
- [ ] At least 1 field-tested translator solution documented
- [ ] Solutions from real translations (not speculation)
- [ ] Authority appropriate: MEDIUM-HIGH for practical guidance
- [ ] Challenge clearly described with cultural contexts
- [ ] Theological stakes noted (purity metaphor importance)
- [ ] No fabricated translation examples

### Level 2: HIGH PRIORITY (80%+)
- [ ] Multiple solutions from different language families
- [ ] Evaluation of solutions (what worked/didn't)

---

## Expected Challenges

**Challenge 1: Finding specific translator notes**
- Solution: Search SIL, Wycliffe, unfoldingWord systematically
- May need to search for "snow" generally, then filter for H7950

**Challenge 2: Distinguishing speculation from field-tested**
- Solution: Look for specific language examples, not hypotheticals
- Verify: Does source cite actual translation?

**Challenge 3: Authority assessment for practitioners**
- Solution: Translation consultants with field experience = MEDIUM-HIGH for practical
- Academic translators without field work = MEDIUM

**Challenge 4: Balancing prescriptive guidance with cultural flexibility**
- Solution: Present multiple strategies, note context-dependence
- Avoid: "THE solution" - acknowledge cultural variation

---

## Success Indicators

**Experiment succeeds if:**
- ✅ Field-tested solutions documented from real translations
- ✅ Authority level appropriate (MEDIUM-HIGH for practical)
- ✅ Translator guidance is actionable
- ✅ Multiple strategies presented (not one-size-fits-all)
- ✅ Theological stakes clearly understood

**Experiment reveals issues if:**
- ❌ Only find theoretical discussion, no field examples
- ❌ Solutions are speculative, not tested
- ❌ Cannot verify authority of translator sources
- ❌ Guidance too vague to be useful

## Special Note: Authority for Practical Guidance

For translator-focused content, authority assessment differs:

**Academic credentials (Ph.D.) + NO field experience = MEDIUM**
- Theory-based, not tested in practice

**M.A./M.Div. + 10+ years field translation = MEDIUM-HIGH for practical**
- Field experience trumps academic credentials for practical guidance
- Mark clearly: "HIGH for practical applications - field-tested"

**SIL/Wycliffe institutional resources = MEDIUM-HIGH**
- Organization with extensive field experience
- Multi-consultant review process

---

## Decision Points

After this experiment, determine:
1. Can we reliably find translator-focused content for cultural challenge words?
2. What's the minimum field experience for MEDIUM-HIGH practical authority?
3. How to balance theoretical translation studies vs. practitioner notes?
4. Which other words have similar cultural translation challenges?

---

## Other Cultural Challenge Words to Consider

If H7950 (snow) succeeds, similar words for future:
- G721 (ἀρνίον - lamb) → Arctic cultures without sheep
- H3899 (לֶחֶם - bread) → Rice cultures
- H1581 (גָּמָל - camel) → Americas/Pacific islands
- H8147 (שְׁנַיִם - two/dual) → Languages with trial number
