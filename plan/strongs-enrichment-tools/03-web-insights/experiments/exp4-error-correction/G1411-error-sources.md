## Expert Sources Found

### Source 1: D.A. Carson - "Exegetical Fallacies"

**Author:** D.A. Carson
**Credentials:**
- Research Professor of New Testament, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School
- Ph.D. in New Testament
- Internationally recognized biblical scholar
- Author of 50+ books

**Authority Level:** VERY HIGH

**How Error is Stated:**
Many preachers render Romans 1:16 as "I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the **dynamite** of God unto salvation for everyone who believes," based on the fact that the word "dynamite" is etymologically derived from δύναμις (dynamis, power, or even miracle).

**Expert Refutation:**
Carson identifies this as "**semantic anachronism**" - specifically "an appeal to a kind of reverse etymology, the root fallacy compounded by anachronism."

**Key Quote (from Carson):**
"Did Paul think of dynamite when he penned this word?"

**Evidence Provided:**
1. **Chronological:** Paul wrote ~50-60 AD; dynamite invented 1867
2. **Conceptual:** "The writers of the New Testament, along with every Greek-speaking person in the first century, knew nothing about anything that could blow stuff up the way dynamite does"
3. **Semantic mismatch:** "Dynamite blows things up, tears things down, rips out rock, gouges holes, destroys things"
4. **Theological contradiction:** Paul identifies God's power with "the power that raised Jesus from the dead" - resurrection power, not destructive power
5. **Directional error:** This is REVERSE etymology - the later word (dynamite) took its name FROM the earlier word (dynamis), not vice versa

**Correct Teaching:**
The power of God that Paul speaks of:
- Is identified with the power that raised Jesus from the dead (Ephesians 1:18-20)
- Operates in us toward salvation
- Aims for wholeness and perfection
- Conforms us to the likeness of Christ
- Is about building up, not tearing down

**Tone:** Firm but not harsh; pedagogical; seeks to correct while educating

**Book Reference:** "Exegetical Fallacies" by D.A. Carson (Baker Publishing Group), pages 33-34

**Source Quality:** PRIMARY SCHOLARLY SOURCE - This is THE definitive academic treatment

### Source 2: Robert Cara - "Word-Study Fallacies" (Ligonier)

**Author:** Robert Cara
**Credentials:**
- Provost and Chief Academic Officer at Reformed Theological Seminary in Charlotte, NC
- Hugh and Sallie Reaves Professor of New Testament
- Ph.D. in New Testament
- Multiple scholarly publications

**Authority Level:** VERY HIGH

**How Error is Stated:**
A pastor might explain that the Greek word *dynamis* inspired Alfred Nobel's 1860s invention "dynamite," leading to interpretations of "explosive power like dynamite" when the Bible speaks of the "power of the Holy Spirit."

**Expert Refutation:**
Cara identifies this as a "**reverse etymological fallacy**" - using later historical usage to determine earlier meaning, which is "flawed reasoning."

**Evidence Provided:**
1. **Methodological:** "Using later historical usage to determine earlier meaning"
2. **Comparative:** Provides other examples like "county" (from feudal counts) and "butterfly" (unrelated to actual insects) to show how etymology doesn't determine current meaning
3. **Linguistic principle:** Actual meaning derives from "current usage" not origin

**Correct Teaching:**
The proper method is: "evaluating many contexts to determine the range of meanings available to the writer/speaker during a specific time period," then applying contextual understanding to determine precise meaning in specific passages.

Better analogy: "constant power like electrical power" rather than "explosive power like dynamite"

**Tone:** Pedagogical and accessible; uses classroom dialogue and everyday examples; gracious

**Teaching Methodology:**
- Provides 4 primary fallacies (including this one)
- Uses English examples to make concepts accessible
- Emphasizes proper methodology alongside corrections

**Source Quality:** HIGH - Scholarly article on reputable theological education site

### Source 3: Bill Mounce - Greek Word Studies Course

**Author:** William D. Mounce
**Credentials:**
- Ph.D. in New Testament
- Professor of New Testament and Director of Greek Language Program at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary
- Author of multiple Greek textbooks including "Basics of Biblical Greek"
- Creator of billmounce.com Greek resources

**Authority Level:** VERY HIGH

**How Error is Stated:**
Common preaching illustration: "The gospel is the δύναμις. That is the Greek word that means 'power'. That is the word that we get 'dynamite' from. And God's power is dynamite! It's powerful!"

**Expert Refutation:**
Mounce explicitly states: "**δύναμις does not have any connection with the idea of blowing up, exploding, destroying, or ripping. The word δύναμις does not mean that.**"

**Key Quote:**
"They took an English word that may or may not have come from δύναμις, and then they used 'dynamite' to define δύναμις."

**Warning:**
"Sometimes you can get away using English cognates to illustrate, but it is **very, very dangerous**."

**Evidence Provided:**
1. **Linguistic:** δύναμις does not semantically include explosive/destructive concepts
2. **Methodological:** You cannot use English derivatives to define Greek words

**Correct Teaching:**
δύναμις means: "power; strength, ability" with nuances including "efficacy," "energy," "authority," and "a manifestation or instance of power."

**Tone:** Direct and clear; authoritative; warning-oriented; protective of proper interpretation

**Source Quality:** HIGH - From formal Greek language instruction by leading NT Greek educator

### Source 4: K.W. Leslie - "The Explosive Power of God?" (TXAB Blog)

**Author:** K.W. Leslie
**Credentials:**
- Studied Greek in seminary
- Theology educator and blogger
- Self-identifies as having made this error earlier in ministry

**Authority Level:** MEDIUM

**How Error is Stated:**
"Pastors are impressed by how similar the word δύναμις/dýnamis is to our English word dynamite." Preachers enthusiastically promoted "the dynamite power of God" with explosive imagery.

**Expert Refutation:**
Leslie discovered through consulting the "Theological Dictionary of the New Testament" that dýnamis represents "cosmic governing force, not destructive energy."

**Evidence Provided:**
1. **Historical:** Alfred Nobel deliberately named dynamite using the Greek word for power (plus -ite suffix) in 1867
2. **Chronological:** Creates false appearance of linguistic connection
3. **Philosophical:** Ancient sources show dýnamis as "fundamental cosmic principle rather than momentary force"

**Correct Teaching:**
"It's a self-originating, self-moving, constant, unending, steady, unstoppable flow. **Not like dynamite. More like a dynamo.**"

Key characteristics:
- Creates order (not destruction)
- Continues indefinitely (not momentary explosion)
- Remains indestructible
- Emphasizes sustainability over destruction

**Tone:** Conversational and gracious; acknowledges own former error; pedagogical; builds credibility through vulnerability

**Teaching Methodology:**
- Uses personal testimony of correction
- Cites Alexander Pope: "A little learning is a dangerous thing"
- Employs comparative analysis and philosophical background
- Balances correction with intellectual engagement

**Source Quality:** MEDIUM - Informal but theologically informed; demonstrates good research methodology

### Source 5: Michael Beard - "Does δύναμις refer to explosive power?" (Word Study Tools)

**Author:** Michael Beard
**Credentials:** Not provided on page

**Authority Level:** MEDIUM-LOW (no credentials visible, but linguistically sound)

**How Error is Stated:**
The claim that δύναμις (dunamis) means "explosive power" or relates etymologically to dynamite because of explosion.

**Expert Refutation:**
Direct statement: "**No, the Greek word in the New Testament for 'power' — δύναμις (dunamis) — does NOT mean 'explode' or 'explosion.'**"

**Evidence Provided:**
1. **Etymological:** Nobel chose "dynamite" in 1867 using the Greek term because it means "power/strength," not because the original word denoted explosion
2. **Linguistic:** Modern Greek uses entirely different words for explosion (ἀνατινάζω, έκρηξη)
3. **Chronological:** The connection to dynamite postdates the ancient Greek term by centuries
4. **Semantic:** Demonstrates dunamis never carried explosive meaning

**Correct Teaching:**
"Power, might, strength, force, capability" emphasizing "sustained, enduring ability rather than momentary force."

**Tone:** Authoritative yet accessible; characterizes the misconception as "violation of natural language use" and "outright error"

**Source Quality:** MEDIUM - Linguistically sound but lacks scholarly citations

### Source 6: Louis (Baker Deep End Blog) - "The Gospel is Not Dynamite"

**Author:** Louis
**Credentials:**
- 1997 graduate of Trinity Evangelical Divinity School (M.Div. implied)
- Cites D.A. Carson's scholarly work

**Authority Level:** MEDIUM (through Carson citation)

**How Error is Stated:**
Claims Romans 1:16 should read "the gospel...is the dynamite of God unto salvation" because "dynamite" derives etymologically from δύναμις (dynamis).

**Expert Refutation:**
Cites Carson's argument: "the root fallacy compounded by anachronism"

**Evidence Provided:**
1. **Historical:** Paul never conceptualized dynamite (didn't exist in 1st century)
2. **Semantic mismatch:** Dynamite "blows things up, tears things down...destroys things"
3. **Theological:** God's power is "the power that raised Jesus from the dead" (Ephesians 1:18-20, Romans 1:16)
4. **Purpose mismatch:** Aimed toward "wholeness and perfection" not destruction

**Correct Teaching:**
Paul's dynamis:
- Associated with resurrection power
- Conforms believers "to the likeness of Christ"
- Directed toward salvation and wholeness

**Tone:** Respectful but firm; describes the practice as "pedagogically inadequate despite good intentions"

**Source Quality:** MEDIUM - Secondary source citing primary scholarship

## Common Patterns Across Corrections

### 1. Fallacy Classification

All sources agree this is a COMPOUND fallacy:
- **Primary:** Semantic anachronism / Reverse etymology
- **Secondary:** Root fallacy
- **Compound:** "Root fallacy compounded by anachronism" (Carson's phrase, widely adopted)

### 2. Evidence Structure

All corrections follow similar evidence pattern:
1. **Chronological impossibility:** NT ~50-95 AD; dynamite 1867
2. **Directional error:** Dynamite named FROM dynamis, not vice versa
3. **Semantic mismatch:** Explosive/destructive vs. creative/sustaining
4. **Theological contradiction:** Resurrection power vs. destructive power
5. **Methodological violation:** Can't use later meanings to define earlier words

### 3. Correct Teaching Components

Consistent elements in proper teaching:
- **Sustained vs. momentary:** "Like a dynamo, not dynamite" (Leslie)
- **Creative vs. destructive:** Builds up, doesn't tear down
- **Resurrection imagery:** Power that raised Christ
- **Soteriological purpose:** Directed toward salvation and wholeness
- **Semantic range:** Power, strength, ability, capability, authority

### 4. Tone Patterns

**Gracious Correction Model:**
- Acknowledge the error is common
- Explain WHY it's wrong (not just THAT it's wrong)
- Provide correct alternative
- Teach proper methodology
- Avoid mockery; use pedagogical approach

**Authority Levels Observed:**
- VERY HIGH: Carson, Cara, Mounce (Ph.D.s, established scholars)
- MEDIUM-HIGH: Seminary graduates citing primary sources
- MEDIUM: Seminary-trained practitioners with research
- MEDIUM-LOW: Sound reasoning but no credentials provided

### 5. Pedagogical Approaches

**Most Effective Methods:**
1. **Use analogies:** "Like a dynamo, not dynamite"
2. **Provide examples:** Other etymological fallacies (butterfly, county)
3. **Cite authorities:** Reference Carson, lexicons, TDNT
4. **Explain methodology:** Teach proper word study principles
5. **Personal testimony:** Acknowledge own past errors (Leslie's approach)
6. **Theological grounding:** Connect to resurrection power

### 6. Widespread Nature of Error

Multiple sources indicate this is:
- "One of the most common" sermon illustrations
- "Classic example" of word study fallacy
- Heard "repeatedly on Christian radio"
- "Pedagogically inadequate despite good intentions"
- Common enough to be THE primary example in Carson's book
