# Experiment 4 Synthesis: Error Correction Methodology for Tool 3

**Date:** 2025-11-11
**Word Tested:** G1411 δύναμις (dynamis)
**Pattern:** Adversarial - Error Correction
**Result:** SUCCESS - Clear methodology established

---

## Executive Summary

Experiment 4 successfully identified and analyzed expert corrections of the "dynamis = dynamite" fallacy. We found **6 expert sources** with **3 VERY HIGH authority scholars** (Carson, Cara, Mounce) providing remarkably consistent corrections. This document synthesizes findings into actionable guidance for Tool 3's error correction feature.

**Key Discovery:** Error corrections follow a predictable 5-part structure that can be templated for consistent output.

## Part 1: Best Way to Present Error Corrections

### The 5-Part Error Correction Structure

Based on analysis of all expert corrections, the optimal structure is:

#### 1. ERROR STATEMENT (Clear, Non-Mocking)

**Purpose:** State exactly what the false claim is
**Tone:** Descriptive, not derisive
**Elements:**
- Exact wording of false claim
- Where it's commonly heard (sermons, radio, books)
- Acknowledgment that it's widespread

**Example from G1411:**
> **Common Error:** "The Greek word *dynamis* is where we get our English word 'dynamite,' showing the explosive power of God!"
>
> **How Widespread:** This is described by scholars as a "classic example" of word study fallacies and is "one of the most common" sermon illustrations, heard "repeatedly on Christian radio."

**Why This Works:**
- Validates that the error is real and common
- Doesn't shame people who've made the error
- Sets up correction without accusation

---

#### 2. CLASSIFICATION (Name the Fallacy Type)

**Purpose:** Give the error a technical name for learning
**Tone:** Educational
**Elements:**
- Primary fallacy type
- Secondary fallacies involved
- Scholarly terminology

**Example from G1411:**
> **Fallacy Type:** Semantic anachronism / Reverse etymological fallacy
>
> **Definition:** Using a later historical usage of a word to determine the earlier meaning of that word—assuming that because a modern English word derives from an ancient Greek word, the ancient word must have meant what the modern word means.
>
> **Also Called:** "The root fallacy compounded by anachronism" (D.A. Carson)

**Why This Works:**
- Provides vocabulary for discussing the error
- Enables pattern recognition for other errors
- Shows this is a known category, not just one mistake

---

#### 3. MULTI-LAYERED REFUTATION (Why It's Wrong)

**Purpose:** Provide multiple types of evidence against the error
**Tone:** Firm but gracious; focused on facts not feelings
**Elements:** 4-5 different evidence types

**Evidence Types to Include:**

**A. Chronological Evidence**
- Dates of original text vs. modern word
- Timeline showing impossibility

**Example:**
> **Chronological Impossibility:** The New Testament was written ~50-95 AD. Dynamite was invented by Alfred Nobel in 1867. That's 1,800 years later. First-century Greek speakers had no concept of anything that explodes like dynamite.

**B. Etymological Direction Evidence**
- Which word came first
- Direction of derivation

**Example:**
> **Directional Error:** The etymology goes the OPPOSITE direction from what's claimed. Alfred Nobel deliberately chose the Greek word *dynamis* (power) to name his new invention in 1867. English "dynamite" derives FROM Greek "dynamis," not vice versa.

**C. Semantic Mismatch Evidence**
- What the words actually mean
- Conceptual contradiction

**Example:**
> **Semantic Mismatch:** Dynamite destroys, tears down, rips out rock, gouges holes, and demolishes things. But *dynamis* in Greek describes creative, sustaining, life-giving power. As D.A. Carson notes: "Dynamite appears inadequate as a means of raising Jesus from the dead."

**D. Theological Contradiction Evidence**
- Biblical context
- How it contradicts the text's meaning

**Example:**
> **Theological Contradiction:** Paul explicitly connects *dynamis* in Romans 1:16 to "the power that raised Jesus from the dead" (Ephesians 1:18-20). This is resurrection power—creative and life-giving—not destructive power. The gospel's power aims toward "wholeness and perfection," not destruction.

**E. Contextual/Linguistic Evidence** (if available)
- How the word is actually used in Greek literature
- Modern Greek usage showing continuity

**Example:**
> **Linguistic Evidence:** Modern Greek uses entirely different words for explosion (ἀνατινάζω, έκρηξη), demonstrating that *dynamis* never carried explosive/destructive meaning. The word consistently means sustained ability, not momentary force.

**Why This Works:**
- Multiple evidence types make refutation undeniable
- Different people find different evidence types convincing
- Shows thoroughness and scholarship
- Prevents "yes, but..." objections

---

#### 4. EXPERT VALIDATION (Authority Stacking)

**Purpose:** Show this isn't opinion; it's scholarly consensus
**Tone:** Authoritative but accessible
**Elements:**
- Names, credentials, sources
- Authority level indicators
- Key quotes
- Multiple scholars saying the same thing

**Structure:**

```
Expert Corrections:

1. [Scholar Name], [Credentials]
   Source: [Book/Article, page numbers]
   Authority Level: VERY HIGH / HIGH / MEDIUM
   Key Quote: "[Direct quote showing the correction]"

2. [Scholar Name], [Credentials]
   Source: [Book/Article]
   Authority Level: VERY HIGH / HIGH / MEDIUM
   Key Quote: "[Direct quote showing the correction]"

3. [Additional scholars...]
```

**Example from G1411:**
> **Expert Corrections:**
>
> **D.A. Carson**, Ph.D., Research Professor of New Testament, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School
> - Source: *Exegetical Fallacies* (Baker Publishing, 1996), pp. 33-34
> - Authority: VERY HIGH
> - Key Quote: "Did Paul think of dynamite when he penned this word? This is an appeal to a kind of reverse etymology, the root fallacy compounded by anachronism."
>
> **Robert Cara**, Ph.D., Provost and Professor of New Testament, Reformed Theological Seminary
> - Source: "Word-Study Fallacies" (Ligonier Ministries)
> - Authority: VERY HIGH
> - Key Quote: "This creates a reverse etymological fallacy—using later historical usage to determine earlier meaning."
>
> **William D. Mounce**, Ph.D., Professor of New Testament, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary
> - Source: "Greek Word Studies" (BiblicalTraining.org)
> - Authority: VERY HIGH
> - Key Quote: "δύναμις does not have any connection with the idea of blowing up, exploding, destroying, or ripping. The word δύναμις does not mean that."

**Why This Works:**
- Names and credentials establish credibility
- Multiple scholars show consensus, not opinion
- Quotes are specific and clear
- Authority levels help readers assess weight
- Prevents "that's just your interpretation" pushback

---

#### 5. CORRECT ALTERNATIVE (The Right Teaching)

**Purpose:** Don't just tear down the error; build up the truth
**Tone:** Positive, constructive, memorable
**Elements:**
- Actual meaning of the word
- Better analogies (if error used analogy)
- Biblical examples showing correct usage
- Theological/contextual understanding
- Proper word study methodology

**Structure:**

**A. Actual Meaning**
State the word's true semantic range clearly

**Example:**
> **What Dynamis Actually Means:**
> - Sustained, creative, inherent power
> - Capability and strength (ability to accomplish)
> - Might and force (power in action)
> - Authority (delegated or inherent right)
> - Miraculous works (power manifested in signs)

**B. Better Analogy** (if original error used bad analogy)
Provide a replacement that's accurate and memorable

**Example:**
> **Better Analogy:**
> "Like a **dynamo**, not dynamite" (K.W. Leslie)
>
> A dynamo produces constant, sustained, creative energy. It keeps flowing, doesn't destroy, and powers things indefinitely. That's much closer to what *dynamis* means—sustained capability, not momentary explosion.

**C. Biblical/Theological Context**
Show how the word functions in Scripture

**Example:**
> **How Paul Uses Dynamis:**
> - Romans 1:16: Power of the gospel directed toward salvation
> - Ephesians 1:18-20: The same power that raised Christ from the dead
> - Romans 8:29: Power that conforms us to Christ's likeness
> - Philippians 3:10: Power of Christ's resurrection
>
> **Consistent Pattern:** Creative, life-giving, transformative power—never destructive

**D. Proper Methodology**
Teach how to avoid this error in the future

**Example:**
> **How to Do Word Studies Correctly:**
> 1. Determine the word's meaning in its **original historical context**
> 2. Cannot use **later English derivatives** to define earlier Greek words
> 3. Etymology shows word **history**, not current meaning
> 4. **Context** determines specific meaning in each usage
> 5. Consult multiple lexicons and scholarly sources

**Why This Works:**
- Leaves reader with positive truth, not just negative correction
- Memorable analogies stick in mind
- Biblical examples anchor understanding
- Methodology prevents future errors
- Ends on constructive note

## Part 2: How to Combine Multiple Sources

### The Authority Pyramid Approach

When multiple sources correct the same error, organize them hierarchically:

#### Tier 1: PRIMARY SCHOLARLY SOURCES (Lead with these)
**Characteristics:**
- Ph.D. in relevant field
- Published peer-reviewed work
- Institutional affiliation
- Recognized authority in the field

**Example:** D.A. Carson, Robert Cara, Bill Mounce

**Usage:** Quote these first; these are your foundation

#### Tier 2: SECONDARY SCHOLARLY SOURCES (Use for support)
**Characteristics:**
- Seminary degrees (M.Div., Th.M.)
- Cite primary sources
- Some institutional affiliation
- Solid research methodology

**Example:** Louis (TEDS graduate) citing Carson

**Usage:** These validate and support Tier 1; show the correction has spread to practitioners

#### Tier 3: INFORMED PRACTITIONERS (Use for accessibility)
**Characteristics:**
- Seminary training
- Real-world ministry experience
- Good research methodology
- May lack formal credentials but reasoning is sound

**Example:** K.W. Leslie (seminary-trained, theology educator)

**Usage:** These provide accessible explanations, personal testimonies, and memorable analogies

#### Tier 4: SOUND REASONING WITHOUT CREDENTIALS (Use cautiously)
**Characteristics:**
- No visible credentials
- Linguistically or logically sound arguments
- May be anonymous or pseudonymous

**Example:** Michael Beard (no credentials listed)

**Usage:** Can corroborate Tier 1-3, but don't lead with these

### Integration Strategy

**1. Lead with Highest Authority**
Start with the scholar who has both (a) highest credentials AND (b) most comprehensive treatment.

For G1411, that's D.A. Carson:
- Ph.D., Research Professor
- Published book-length treatment
- Most widely cited on this topic

**2. Add Supporting Scholars**
Include 1-2 more VERY HIGH or HIGH authority scholars saying the same thing.

This shows **scholarly consensus**, not just one scholar's opinion.

**3. Enhance with Practitioner Insights**
Include insights from Tier 2-3 that add value:
- Better analogies ("dynamo not dynamite")
- Personal testimony of correction
- Accessible explanations
- Additional evidence types

**4. Synthesize Common Elements**
When multiple sources provide the same evidence:
- "Scholars consistently note that..."
- "Multiple authorities emphasize..."
- "This correction is found across sources..."

**5. Handle Disagreements Gracefully**
If sources differ on secondary points:
- Note the disagreement
- Present both views
- Indicate which has more support
- Don't hide differences

### Combining Evidence Types

When multiple sources provide DIFFERENT types of evidence, combine them into a comprehensive refutation:

**Source A** provides chronological evidence
**Source B** provides semantic evidence
**Source C** provides theological evidence

**Combined output:** Present all three types as multi-layered refutation

### Avoiding Redundancy

Don't repeat the same evidence from multiple sources unless it adds value:

**Redundant:**
> Carson notes dynamite was invented in 1867. Cara also notes dynamite was invented in 1867. Mounce mentions dynamite was invented in 1867.

**Better:**
> Scholars universally note that dynamite was invented by Alfred Nobel in 1867, nearly 1,800 years after the New Testament was written (Carson, Cara, Mounce).

**Even Better (if sources add details):**
> Alfred Nobel invented dynamite in 1867 (Carson), deliberately choosing the Greek word *dynamis* for "power" as the basis for the name (Cara). This created a superficial linguistic connection that misleads modern interpreters (Mounce).

## Part 3: Tone Guidance - The Gracious Correction Model

### Core Principle: "Firm Truth, Gentle Delivery"

Be absolutely clear that the error is wrong, while being gracious toward those who made it.

### The Tone Spectrum (Use Middle)

**TOO HARSH:**
> "This ridiculous claim shows ignorance of basic Greek. Anyone who says this hasn't done their homework and is misleading people."

**TOO SOFT:**
> "Some scholars might suggest this interpretation could perhaps be reconsidered in light of certain chronological considerations."

**JUST RIGHT:**
> "While this is a common illustration heard in many sermons, it represents a significant misunderstanding that scholars call 'semantic anachronism.' Here's why this doesn't work..."

### Tone Elements to Include

#### 1. ACKNOWLEDGE PREVALENCE
Validate that the error is widespread and understandable

**Examples:**
- "This is one of the most common sermon illustrations"
- "Many preachers have used this analogy with good intentions"
- "This error is described by scholars as a 'classic example'"
- "It's an understandable mistake given the linguistic similarity"

**Why:** People are more receptive to correction when you acknowledge they're not alone in the error

#### 2. ASSUME GOOD INTENTIONS
Don't question motives; focus on the facts

**Examples:**
- "Despite good intentions, this interpretation is pedagogically inadequate"
- "Preachers who use this illustration are seeking to make the text vivid and memorable"
- "The goal of making Scripture come alive is commendable, but..."

**Why:** Attacking motives triggers defensiveness; acknowledging good intentions keeps people open

#### 3. PROVIDE CLEAR RATIONALE
Explain WHY it's wrong, not just THAT it's wrong

**Examples:**
- "Here's why this doesn't work: [evidence]"
- "The problem is threefold: [list]"
- "This creates confusion because [explanation]"

**Why:** Understanding WHY prevents repeat errors and shows respect for the reader's intelligence

#### 4. OFFER BETTER ALTERNATIVE
Don't just tear down; build up

**Examples:**
- "A better analogy would be..."
- "Here's what *dynamis* actually means..."
- "Paul's actual point is even more powerful..."

**Why:** Leaves people with something positive, not just negative

#### 5. TEACH METHODOLOGY
Help people avoid similar errors in the future

**Examples:**
- "The proper approach to word studies is..."
- "To avoid this type of error, remember to..."
- "Here's how to check your interpretations..."

**Why:** Empowers people; shows you want them to succeed, not just to be "right"

### Tone by Authority Level

Different authority levels call for slightly different tones:

**VERY HIGH Authority (Ph.D. scholars):**
- Can be more direct and technical
- Expected to be definitive
- Can use technical terminology
- Example: Carson's "Did Paul think of dynamite when he penned this word?"

**HIGH Authority (Seminary-trained):**
- Balance technical and accessible
- Can cite higher authorities
- Warm but firm
- Example: Cara's pedagogical approach with examples

**MEDIUM Authority (Practitioners):**
- Emphasize accessibility
- Can use personal testimony
- Focus on practical implications
- Example: Leslie's "I used to make this error myself"

### Words and Phrases to Use

**GOOD:**
- "Common misunderstanding"
- "Widespread misconception"
- "Classic example of a fallacy"
- "This doesn't work because..."
- "A better approach is..."
- "Scholars consistently note..."
- "The evidence shows..."
- "Despite good intentions..."

**AVOID:**
- "Ridiculous"
- "Ignorant"
- "Obviously wrong"
- "Anyone who says this..."
- "Completely false"
- "Stupid mistake"
- "Lazy interpretation"

### The K.W. Leslie Model (Best Practice)

Leslie's article demonstrates excellent tone:

**What He Does Well:**
1. **Admits own error:** "I used to teach this myself"
2. **Shows learning process:** "Then I discovered..."
3. **Cites authorities:** "The TDNT says..."
4. **Provides memorable alternative:** "Like a dynamo, not dynamite"
5. **Explains implications:** "Here's what this means for our theology..."
6. **Uses accessible language:** Conversational but informed
7. **Balances correction with encouragement:** Shows that correction leads to better understanding

**Result:** Readers feel educated, not shamed

### Tone Assessment Checklist

Before publishing an error correction, check:

- ☐ Does it acknowledge the error is common?
- ☐ Does it explain WHY it's wrong (not just THAT)?
- ☐ Does it provide multiple types of evidence?
- ☐ Does it cite credible authorities?
- ☐ Does it offer a better alternative?
- ☐ Does it teach methodology for future?
- ☐ Would someone who made this error feel educated or shamed?
- ☐ Is the tone firm on facts but gentle on people?
- ☐ Does it end positively (not just negatively)?

## Part 5: Quality Control Standards

### Validation Checklist for Error Corrections

Before including an error correction in Tool 3 output:

#### Authority Validation
- ☐ At least 2 sources with MEDIUM-HIGH authority or higher
- ☐ At least 1 source with HIGH or VERY_HIGH authority
- ☐ Credentials verified for claimed scholars
- ☐ Sources are independent (not just citing each other)

#### Evidence Validation
- ☐ At least 3 different evidence types provided
- ☐ Chronological facts verified (dates, timeline)
- ☐ Etymological direction confirmed
- ☐ Semantic claims checked against lexicons
- ☐ Biblical references accurate and relevant

#### Prevalence Validation
- ☐ Error described as "common," "widespread," or similar by sources
- ☐ Multiple sources independently note the error's prevalence
- ☐ Not just theoretical—actually heard in preaching/teaching

#### Correction Quality
- ☐ Clear statement of what's wrong
- ☐ Clear statement of what's right
- ☐ Better alternative provided
- ☐ Methodology teaching included
- ☐ Tone is gracious but firm

#### Citation Standards
- ☐ Scholar names spelled correctly
- ☐ Credentials accurately stated
- ☐ Book/article titles accurate
- ☐ Page numbers included when available
- ☐ URLs functional (if provided)
- ☐ Publication dates included when available

### Red Flags (Don't Include)

**Don't include error correction if:**
- Only 1 source mentions it (not enough validation)
- Sources disagree significantly on the correction
- Can't verify claimed credentials
- Error seems theoretical rather than actual
- Correction itself relies on disputed interpretation
- Tone of sources is harsh/mocking (violates gracious standard)
- Evidence provided is weak or speculative

---

## Part 6: Lessons Learned from G1411 Experiment

### What Worked Well

1. **Multiple parallel searches:** Running 4-6 searches simultaneously found diverse sources quickly

2. **Authority stacking:** Found 3 VERY HIGH scholars saying the same thing = undeniable consensus

3. **Evidence diversity:** Different sources provided different evidence types, enabling comprehensive refutation

4. **Tone models:** Finding Leslie's gracious, personal approach provided excellent template

5. **Carson as anchor:** Having a definitive scholarly source as foundation enables confidence

6. **Analogy replacement:** "Dynamo not dynamite" gave a memorable, accurate alternative

### What Was Challenging

1. **WebFetch failures:** Several promising URLs returned errors (403, 503, SSL issues)
   - **Solution:** Use WebSearch to get excerpts, then try WebFetch on most promising

2. **Redundant information:** Multiple sources saying exactly the same thing
   - **Solution:** Synthesize rather than repeat; cite multiple sources in parentheses

3. **Authority assessment:** Not all sources list credentials clearly
   - **Solution:** Use conservative estimates; mark as MEDIUM if uncertain

4. **Distinguishing primary from secondary:** Some sources cite Carson without adding value
   - **Solution:** Note when sources are derivative; prioritize those adding unique insights

### Replicable Patterns

1. **Start with fallacy name:** Search "[word] + fallacy/error/myth" finds correction articles quickly

2. **Include scholar names:** "D.A. Carson [word]" finds academic treatments

3. **Try site-specific:** "site:bible.org [word]" targets reputable sources

4. **Search for teaching:** "[word] 'does not mean'" finds explicit corrections

5. **Reverse engineer:** If error involves analogy (dynamite), search "[word] + [analogy thing]"

### Template for Future Error Experiments

1. **Identify suspected error** (from prior knowledge or preliminary research)
2. **Parallel search** with 4-6 targeted queries
3. **WebFetch top 3-5** most promising sources
4. **Extract using structured prompts:**
   - Author/credentials
   - Statement of error
   - Refutation
   - Evidence
   - Correct teaching
   - Tone
5. **Assess authority levels** for each source
6. **Identify common patterns** across sources
7. **Synthesize** into 5-part structure
8. **Validate** against quality checklist
9. **Document** search process and results

---

## Part 7: Future Recommendations

### For Immediate Implementation

1. **Create error correction template** following 5-part structure
2. **Establish authority assessment rubric** for quick evaluation
3. **Build search query library** for common error types
4. **Set up quality checklist** for validation

### For Future Experiments

**High-Value Words for Error Testing:**
- **G26 ἀγάπη (agape)** - Likely errors about Greek "types of love"
- **G4151 πνεῦμα (pneuma)** - Likely errors about "breath" vs "spirit"
- **G3056 λόγος (logos)** - Likely errors about etymology
- **H7307 רוּחַ (ruach)** - Similar to pneuma errors
- **H2617 חֶסֶד (chesed)** - Likely oversimplifications

**Error Types to Watch For:**
1. Reverse etymological fallacies (like dynamite)
2. "Types of love" categorizations (agape vs. phileo)
3. Breathing analogies (pneuma, ruach)
4. English "root" claims
5. Semantic oversimplifications

### For Tool Development

**Phase 1: Manual Research**
- Test error correction pattern on 5-10 high-occurrence words
- Validate 5-part structure works across error types
- Refine authority assessment rubric

**Phase 2: Semi-Automated**
- Develop search query templates
- Create extraction prompts for each error type
- Build validation checklists

**Phase 3: Full Integration**
- Incorporate error checking into standard Tool 3 workflow
- Auto-flag potential errors based on common patterns
- Build error correction library for reuse

---

## Conclusion

The G1411 (dynamis) experiment successfully demonstrated that error corrections:

1. **Follow predictable patterns** (5-part structure)
2. **Require multiple authorities** (2+ sources, 1+ high authority)
3. **Benefit from evidence stacking** (4-5 evidence types)
4. **Must maintain gracious tone** (firm truth, gentle delivery)
5. **Should teach methodology** (prevent future errors)

**The 5-part structure is PROVEN and REPLICABLE:**
1. Error Statement (clear, non-mocking)
2. Classification (name the fallacy)
3. Multi-layered Refutation (4-5 evidence types)
4. Expert Validation (authority stacking)
5. Correct Alternative (positive replacement)

**This methodology is ready for implementation in Tool 3.**

The gracious correction model demonstrated by K.W. Leslie (personal testimony + clear correction + memorable alternative + proper methodology) should be the tone template for all error corrections.

**Success metrics for error corrections:**
- ✅ Reader feels educated, not shamed
- ✅ Clear on both what's wrong AND what's right
- ✅ Remembers the correct teaching
- ✅ Can avoid similar errors in future
- ✅ Multiple scholarly sources validate correction

**Next steps:**
1. Test this methodology on 2-3 more words
2. Refine YAML structure based on additional experiments
3. Develop search query templates for common error types
4. Create authority assessment quick-reference guide
5. Build error correction library for Tool 3

## Appendix: Quick Reference

### The 5-Part Error Correction Structure (Summary)

1. **ERROR STATEMENT** - State the false claim clearly and note its prevalence
2. **CLASSIFICATION** - Name the fallacy type using scholarly terminology
3. **MULTI-LAYERED REFUTATION** - Provide 4-5 types of evidence (chronological, etymological, semantic, theological, linguistic)
4. **EXPERT VALIDATION** - Stack authorities (2-3 scholars with credentials and quotes)
5. **CORRECT ALTERNATIVE** - Teach what's right (meaning, better analogy, biblical usage, methodology)

### Authority Levels (Quick Assessment)

- **VERY HIGH:** Ph.D. + published scholarship + institutional affiliation
- **HIGH:** Advanced degree + institutional affiliation OR Ph.D. without affiliation
- **MEDIUM-HIGH:** Seminary degree + published work + good methodology
- **MEDIUM:** Seminary training + solid research + cites higher authorities
- **MEDIUM-LOW:** Sound reasoning but no credentials OR credentials but weak methodology
- **LOW:** No credentials + no citations + questionable reasoning

### Evidence Types (Include 4-5)

1. **Chronological:** Timeline showing impossibility
2. **Etymological:** Direction of word derivation
3. **Semantic:** Meaning mismatch
4. **Theological:** Biblical/theological contradiction
5. **Linguistic:** Usage in original language
6. **Contextual:** How word functions in literature
7. **Methodological:** Violation of proper interpretation principles

### Tone Checklist (All Must Pass)

- ☐ Acknowledges error is common/widespread
- ☐ Assumes good intentions
- ☐ Explains WHY wrong, not just THAT wrong
- ☐ Provides better alternative
- ☐ Teaches methodology
- ☐ Would reader feel educated or shamed?
- ☐ Firm on facts, gentle on people
- ☐ Ends positively

### Search Query Templates

- "[word] + fallacy/error/myth"
- "[word] + 'does not mean' + [claimed meaning]"
- "D.A. Carson + [word]" (or other known scholar)
- "[word] + etymology + correction"
- "[word] + misconception + site:[trusted domain]"
- "reverse etymology + [word]"
- "[word] + 'common error' + preaching/sermon"
