# Experiment 2: Medium-Coverage Word

**Strong's Number:** G1343
**Lemma:** δικαιοσύνη (dikaiosynē)
**Gloss:** "righteousness, justice"
**Occurrences:** 92 times in NT

---

## Purpose

Test Tool 3 methodology on a word with moderate web coverage. This word is theologically important but less commonly studied in popular contexts than "agape" or "grace."

**What We're Testing:**
- Can we find 2-3 quality sources?
- Does quality remain high with fewer sources?
- How to handle gaps when sources are limited?
- Does authority detection work with less abundant data?
- Is there still value-add over lexicon data?

---

## Expected Sources

### Likely to Find (2-3 sources)
- **Bible.org:** Theological articles on righteousness/justification
- **NetBible.org:** Translator notes on key righteousness passages (Rom 3:21-22, Matt 6:33)
- **STEPBible.org:** Extended definitions, semantic data

### Possibly Find (1-2 sources)
- **Seminary professor blog:** If righteousness/justification is research area
- **SIL translator notes:** If cultural translation challenges exist
- **WordExplain.com:** If word study available

### Unlikely to Find
- Multiple dedicated articles (not as popular as agape or grace)
- Teaching illustration resources (less accessible topic)
- Extensive error correction content (fewer common misconceptions)

---

## Search Strategy

### Phase 1: Source Discovery
```
WebSearch queries:
1. "G1343 dikaiosyne" OR "δικαιοσύνη" site:bible.org
2. "righteousness" "δικαιοσύνη" site:netbible.org
3. "G1343" site:stepbible.org
4. "dikaiosyne righteousness" site:billmounce.com
5. "righteousness translation" site:sil.org OR site:unfoldingword.org
6. "δικαιοσύνη" scholar blog (general search)
```

### Phase 2: Content Extraction
For each source found:
1. WebFetch with focused prompt
2. Extract: theological significance, translation challenges
3. Verify: credentials, authority level
4. Note: What's missing compared to Experiment 1

### Phase 3: Synthesis
1. Read Tool 1 output
2. Combine insights from available sources
3. Be honest about coverage: "Limited web resources for practical applications"
4. Focus on what IS available rather than fabricating content

---

## Expected Content Categories

### Modern Insights (Limited)
- Righteousness vs. justice translation debate
- Forensic vs. ethical righteousness distinction
- Pauline vs. Matthean usage patterns
- LXX background (Hebrew צְדָקָה tsedaqah connection)

### Practical Applications

**For Translators:**
- Righteousness vs. justice: which English word in which context?
- Cultural concepts of righteousness/justice vary
- Preserving forensic legal metaphor in translation
- Cultures without abstract righteousness concept

**For Preachers:**
- Teaching justification/righteousness connection
- Old covenant vs. new covenant righteousness
- Sermon guidance on Romans 3, Matthew 5-6

**For Students:**
- Connection to justification terminology
- Hebrew background study
- Cross-references OT/NT

### Error Corrections (If Available)
- Possible: Over-separation of righteousness/justice (same Greek word)
- Possible: Ethical righteousness vs. imputed righteousness confusion

### Teaching Helps (Likely Limited)
- Relationship to justification doctrine
- Hebrew צְדָקָה connection
- Semantic field of legal terminology

## Validation Criteria

### Level 1: CRITICAL (Must Pass)
- [ ] 2-3 quality sources found (lower than Exp 1, acceptable)
- [ ] All sources have verifiable credentials
- [ ] Authority levels clearly marked
- [ ] No fabricated data to fill gaps
- [ ] Tool 1 read first, no contradictions
- [ ] Content adds value (even if less abundant)

### Level 2: HIGH PRIORITY (80%+)
- [ ] Modern insights present (even if fewer)
- [ ] At least 1 practical application category covered
- [ ] Honest about limited coverage (no fake content)
- [ ] Quality maintained despite fewer sources
- [ ] Coverage notes explain limitations

### Level 3: MEDIUM PRIORITY (60%+)
- [ ] Author credentials documented
- [ ] Cross-references to Tool 1
- [ ] Verification dates recorded
- [ ] Flags gaps for potential future sources

## Expected Challenges

**Challenge 1: Fewer sources available**
- Solution: Don't fabricate, be honest about coverage
- Note in metadata: "Moderate web coverage, 2-3 sources found"

**Challenge 2: Sources may overlap significantly**
- Solution: Synthesize common insights, cite both sources
- Focus: Convergence shows reliability

**Challenge 3: Practical applications may be limited**
- Solution: Extract what's available, note gaps
- Don't invent applications not in sources

**Challenge 4: May require deeper search effort**
- Solution: Try additional search strategies
- Seminary faculty pages, translation org sites

## Comparison to Experiment 1

| Aspect | Exp 1 (Agape) | Exp 2 (Righteousness) |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Expected Sources** | 5+ | 2-3 |
| **Authority Range** | MEDIUM-HIGH to MEDIUM | MEDIUM to MEDIUM-LOW |
| **Practical Apps** | All audiences | Mostly theological |
| **Error Corrections** | Likely present | Possibly present |
| **Teaching Helps** | Abundant | Limited |
| **Search Difficulty** | Easy | Moderate |

---

## Success Indicators

**Experiment succeeds if:**
- ✅ 2-3 quality sources located
- ✅ Authority detection still works
- ✅ Output adds value despite fewer sources
- ✅ Honest about coverage limitations
- ✅ Quality maintained with less data

**Experiment reveals issues if:**
- ❌ Cannot find even 2 quality sources
- ❌ Sources only repeat lexicon data
- ❌ Temptation to fabricate to fill gaps
- ❌ Extraction not worth the effort

---

## Decision Point

After this experiment, assess:
1. What's the minimum source count for Tool 3 inclusion? (1? 2? 3?)
2. How to handle gaps gracefully?
3. Should some words be marked "insufficient web coverage"?
4. Is there still value with 2-3 sources vs. 5+?

---

## Output Files

After experiment completion:
1. `G1343-output.yaml` - Full output following schema
2. `G1343-learnings.md` - Coverage limitations, methodology notes
3. `G1343-sources-log.md` - Search attempts, what was/wasn't found
4. `G1343-validation.md` - Validation results, gap analysis

---

## Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Source Discovery):** 40 minutes (more search effort)
- **Phase 2 (Content Extraction):** 30 minutes (fewer sources)
- **Phase 3 (Synthesis):** 20 minutes
- **Validation:** 15 minutes
- **Total:** ~2 hours

---

## Next Steps After Experiment

1. Compare Exp 1 vs. Exp 2 learnings
2. Establish minimum viable source count
3. Document gap-handling strategy
4. Proceed to Experiment 3 (controversial word)

---

**Status:** Experiment design complete, ready to execute
**Expected Outcome:** Successful with adaptations - fewer sources but still valuable
