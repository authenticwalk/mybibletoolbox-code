# Experiment 1: High-Coverage Word

**Strong's Number:** G26
**Lemma:** ἀγάπη (agapē)
**Gloss:** "love"
**Occurrences:** 116 times in NT

---

## Purpose

Test Tool 3 methodology on a word with excellent web coverage. This word is theologically central, extensively discussed by scholars, and has practical applications for translators and teachers.

**What We're Testing:**
- Can we find 5+ quality expert sources?
- Do sources add value beyond lexicon data (Tool 1)?
- Are authority levels assigned correctly?
- Do practical applications emerge naturally?
- Is error correction content available?

---

## Expected Sources

### Expert Blogs (MEDIUM authority)
- **Bill Mounce:** Greek word studies, likely has agape/phileo comparison
- **Michael Heiser:** Theological significance, LXX connections
- **Rob Plummer:** NT usage patterns, exegetical insights

### Structured Sites (MEDIUM-HIGH authority)
- **STEPBible.org:** Extended definitions, semantic domain data
- **NetBible.org:** Translator notes on key agape passages (John 3:16, 1 Cor 13)
- **Bible.org:** Theological articles, practical teaching

### Translator Resources (MEDIUM-HIGH for practical)
- **SIL/Wycliffe notes:** How to translate love in cultures with different love categories
- **UnfoldingWord:** Translation helps, cross-cultural considerations

---

## Search Strategy

### Phase 1: Source Discovery
```
WebSearch queries:
1. "G26 agape" OR "ἀγάπη" site:billmounce.com
2. "agape love" site:bible.org
3. "G26" OR "agape" site:netbible.org
4. "agape" site:stepbible.org
5. "agape translation" site:sil.org OR "agape" site:unfoldingword.org
```

### Phase 2: Content Extraction
For each source found:
1. WebFetch with targeted prompt
2. Extract: modern insights, practical applications, teaching helps
3. Verify: author credentials, citations present
4. Assign: authority level (MEDIUM-HIGH, MEDIUM, or MEDIUM-LOW)

### Phase 3: Synthesis
1. Read Tool 1 output first (avoid duplication)
2. Combine unique insights from all sources
3. Organize by category: insights, applications, teaching
4. Generate output YAML

---

## Expected Content Categories

### Modern Insights
- Contemporary scholarly perspectives on agape vs. phileo distinction
- Theological significance in NT (especially Johannine literature)
- Semantic development from LXX to NT
- Recent scholarship on love terminology

### Practical Applications

**For Translators:**
- Cultures with multiple love words: how to map agape
- Cultures with no love-specific vocabulary: descriptive strategies
- Theological weight preservation in translation
- Cross-cultural metaphors for sacrificial love

**For Preachers:**
- Teaching the agape/phileo distinction (accurate presentation)
- Sermon illustrations grounded in scholarship
- Common errors to avoid (over-reading distinctions)
- 1 Corinthians 13 exposition guidance

**For Students:**
- Memory aids for NT love vocabulary
- Study questions for passages with agape
- Cross-reference guidance (connecting OT/NT love concepts)

### Error Corrections
- **Common error:** "Agape = God's love, phileo = human love" (oversimplification)
- **Expert correction:** Context determines, not word alone (e.g., John 21:15-17)
- **Evidence:** Scholarly analysis showing overlap in usage

### Teaching Helps
- Comparison chart: agape, phileo, eros, storge
- Cultural background: love in Greco-Roman world
- Theological framework: love in biblical theology

## Validation Criteria

### Level 1: CRITICAL (Must Pass)
- [ ] 5+ quality sources found and vetted
- [ ] All sources have verifiable credentials
- [ ] Authority levels clearly marked
- [ ] No fabricated data
- [ ] Tool 1 read first, no contradictions
- [ ] Content adds value beyond lexicons

### Level 2: HIGH PRIORITY (80%+)
- [ ] Modern insights from expert sources (not opinion)
- [ ] Practical applications for all 3 audiences (translators, preachers, students)
- [ ] Error corrections with evidence
- [ ] Teaching helps are appropriate
- [ ] Multiple sources per major insight

### Level 3: MEDIUM PRIORITY (60%+)
- [ ] Author credentials documented in output
- [ ] Translator guidance is field-tested
- [ ] Cross-references to Tool 1 and Tool 2
- [ ] Verification dates recorded

## Expected Challenges

**Challenge 1: Over-abundance of sources**
- Solution: Be selective, choose highest quality
- Prioritize: Ph.D. scholars > M.Div. teachers > ministry sites

**Challenge 2: Repetition across sources**
- Solution: Synthesize common insights, cite multiple sources
- Focus: What's unique about each source's contribution

**Challenge 3: Distinguishing Tool 1 vs. Tool 3 content**
- Solution: Tool 1 = lexicon data, Tool 3 = modern insights + applications
- If source just repeats Thayer's, skip it

**Challenge 4: Authority level assignment**
- Solution: Apply systematic criteria from authority-detection.md
- Document: Why each source gets its assigned level

---

## Success Indicators

**Experiment succeeds if:**
- ✅ 5+ quality sources located and extracted
- ✅ Authority detection framework works in practice
- ✅ Output YAML demonstrates clear value-add over Tool 1
- ✅ Practical applications present for multiple audiences
- ✅ All validation criteria pass

**Experiment reveals issues if:**
- ❌ Cannot find 5 quality sources (unlikely for agape)
- ❌ Sources duplicate Tool 1 without added value
- ❌ Authority levels difficult to assign
- ❌ Extraction process too time-consuming

---

## Output Files

After experiment completion:
1. `G26-output.yaml` - Full output following schema
2. `G26-learnings.md` - What worked, what needs adjustment
3. `G26-sources-log.md` - All sources checked, authority assessment
4. `G26-validation.md` - Validation checklist results

---

## Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Source Discovery):** 30 minutes
- **Phase 2 (Content Extraction):** 60 minutes (5+ sources)
- **Phase 3 (Synthesis):** 30 minutes
- **Validation:** 20 minutes
- **Total:** ~2.5 hours

---

## Next Steps After Experiment

1. Review output against validation criteria
2. Document learnings (what worked, what didn't)
3. Identify methodology refinements needed
4. Proceed to Experiment 2 (medium coverage)

---

**Status:** Experiment design complete, ready to execute
**Expected Outcome:** Successful - agape has excellent web coverage
