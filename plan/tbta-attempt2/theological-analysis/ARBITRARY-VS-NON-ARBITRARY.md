# Theological Framework: Arbitrary vs Non-Arbitrary Lexical Choices in Bible Translation

**Core Problem**: When predicting implicit linguistic features for Bible translation, we must distinguish between theologically neutral choices (arbitrary) and theologically significant choices (non-arbitrary) that affect doctrine, interpretation, or practice.

**Guiding Principle**: We must prevent eisegesis (reading meaning INTO the text) while enabling exegesis (drawing meaning FROM the text).

---

## 1. Theological Framework for Determining Arbitrarity

### Core Criteria for Non-Arbitrary Classification

A lexical choice is **NON-ARBITRARY** when it meets ANY of these criteria:

#### A. Doctrinal Impact
- **Trinity**: Affects understanding of God's nature (Gen 1:26, Matt 28:19)
- **Christology**: Affects understanding of Christ's nature/work
- **Soteriology**: Affects understanding of salvation
- **Pneumatology**: Affects understanding of the Holy Spirit
- **Ecclesiology**: Affects church practice or structure
- **Eschatology**: Affects end times interpretation
- **Anthropology**: Affects understanding of human nature

#### B. Divine Speech Impact
- Commands from God (changes obedience requirements)
- Promises from God (changes what believers can claim)
- Judgments from God (changes understanding of consequences)
- Revelations about God's nature (changes theology proper)

#### C. Interpretive Disambiguation
- Resolves ambiguity with theological ramifications
- Creates ambiguity that opens false teaching possibilities
- Affects whether passage is literal vs figurative
- Changes referent identification (who/what is being discussed)

#### D. Historical Church Consensus
- Major denominations interpret differently based on this choice
- Early church fathers addressed this specific issue
- Creedal statements depend on this interpretation
- Church splits have occurred over this interpretation

#### E. Practical Ministry Impact
- Changes how passage is preached
- Affects pastoral counseling applications
- Influences worship practices
- Impacts ethical decisions

### Classification Decision Tree

```
1. Does choice affect core doctrine? → NON-ARBITRARY
2. Is this divine speech with commands/promises? → NON-ARBITRARY
3. Does choice resolve/create theological ambiguity? → NON-ARBITRARY
4. Is there denominational disagreement on this? → NON-ARBITRARY
5. Would different choices lead to different applications? → NON-ARBITRARY
6. Otherwise → ARBITRARY
```

## 2. Feature-by-Feature Arbitrarity Analysis

### NUMBER SYSTEM

#### Non-Arbitrary Contexts (Theological Stakes)
1. **Trinity References (Gen 1:26, Matt 28:19)**
   - TRIAL vs PLURAL changes doctrine
   - Stakes: Nature of God, Trinity doctrine
   - Required: Multiple valid theological perspectives

2. **Divine Unity Statements (Deut 6:4)**
   - SINGULAR vs PLURAL changes monotheism
   - Stakes: Core Jewish/Christian/Islamic doctrine
   - Required: Preserve monotheistic reading

3. **Resurrection Appearances**
   - Number of angels/witnesses affects historicity claims
   - Stakes: Resurrection credibility
   - Required: Preserve textual ambiguity where it exists

#### Arbitrary Contexts (No Theological Impact)
1. **Crowd Sizes** - 50 vs 100 people doesn't change meaning
2. **Generic Groups** - "disciples" as paucal vs plural
3. **Non-specific References** - "some", "many", "all"

### PERSON SYSTEM (CLUSIVITY)

#### Non-Arbitrary Contexts
1. **Divine Self-Reference (Gen 1:26, 3:22, 11:7)**
   - INCLUSIVE = Trinity speaking internally
   - EXCLUSIVE = God + angels/humans
   - Stakes: Trinity doctrine, creation theology
   - Required: Present both perspectives with rationale

2. **Prayer Contexts (Matt 6:9 "Our Father")**
   - INCLUSIVE = speaker + hearers pray together
   - EXCLUSIVE = speaker teaches others to pray
   - Stakes: Corporate vs individual prayer theology
   - Required: Context-sensitive analysis

3. **Apostolic Authority (1 Cor 1:23 "we preach")**
   - EXCLUSIVE = apostles only (authority claim)
   - INCLUSIVE = all believers (universal calling)
   - Stakes: Church authority structure
   - Required: Preserve ambiguity or flag alternatives

#### Arbitrary Contexts
1. **Narrative "we" in travel accounts** (Acts 16:10)
2. **General exhortations** without authority claims

### ASPECT

#### Non-Arbitrary Contexts
1. **Salvation Statements**
   - PERFECTIVE = completed action ("you have been saved")
   - IMPERFECTIVE = ongoing process ("you are being saved")
   - Stakes: Once-saved-always-saved debates
   - Required: Present both theological traditions

2. **Prophetic Fulfillment**
   - COMPLETED = prophecy fulfilled
   - ONGOING = prophecy being fulfilled
   - Stakes: Eschatological timeline
   - Required: Preserve source ambiguity

#### Arbitrary Contexts
1. **Historical narrative** - past events
2. **Physical actions** - walking, eating, sleeping

### MOOD

#### Non-Arbitrary Contexts
1. **Divine Commands**
   - IMPERATIVE = requirement
   - SUBJUNCTIVE = suggestion
   - Stakes: What God requires vs recommends
   - Required: High confidence or multiple options

2. **Conditional Promises**
   - INDICATIVE = will happen
   - SUBJUNCTIVE = might happen
   - Stakes: Certainty of God's promises
   - Required: Preserve conditional nature

#### Arbitrary Contexts
1. **Human suggestions** between equals
2. **Narrative descriptions** of events

### ILLOCUTIONARY FORCE

#### Non-Arbitrary Contexts
1. **Jesus's Statements**
   - COMMAND vs REQUEST changes authority
   - ASSERTION vs QUESTION changes teaching method
   - Stakes: Christ's authority and pedagogy
   - Required: Clear contextual justification

2. **Prophetic Utterances**
   - WARNING vs PREDICTION changes response required
   - Stakes: Human responsibility vs divine decree
   - Required: Both perspectives when ambiguous

#### Arbitrary Contexts
1. **Casual conversation** between humans
2. **Narrative transitions**

### DISCOURSE GENRE

#### Non-Arbitrary Contexts
1. **Apocalyptic Literature**
   - LITERAL vs SYMBOLIC changes interpretation
   - Stakes: End times theology, millennialism debates
   - Required: Flag interpretive traditions

2. **Parables**
   - HISTORICAL vs FICTIONAL changes authority
   - Stakes: Biblical historicity
   - Required: Preserve genre markers

#### Arbitrary Contexts
1. **Clear narrative** sections
2. **Genealogies** and lists

    if affects_doctrine(['Trinity', 'salvation', 'christology']):
        return True, 'doctrinal'

    # Check divine speech
    if is_divine_command_or_promise():
        return True, 'divine_speech'

    # Check ambiguity resolution
    if resolves_or_creates_theological_ambiguity():
        return True, 'theological_ambiguity'

    return False, None
```

If non-arbitrary, output multiple perspectives:

## Critical Implementation Notes

1. **Default to Non-Arbitrary When Uncertain**: Better to over-flag than miss theological significance

2. **Never Manufacture Consensus**: If denominations disagree, present all major views

3. **Preserve Source Ambiguity**: If Greek/Hebrew is ambiguous, maintain that ambiguity

4. **Cultural Humility**: Western theological categories may not be universal

5. **Translation Freedom**: Provide guidance but respect translator's theological tradition

6. **Cascading Validation**: Non-arbitrary cases need theological → cultural → practical review

---

## Examples by Feature

### Number System + Trinity (Non-Arbitrary)
- **Verse**: Genesis 1:26
- **Arbitrary**: No
- **Why**: Trinity doctrine depends on trial vs plural
- **Handling**: Present trial (Trinity), plural (divine council), and majestic plural options

### Number System + Crowd Size (Arbitrary)
- **Verse**: Mark 6:44 "five thousand men"
- **Arbitrary**: Yes (for languages needing to specify dual/trial/paucal/plural)
- **Why**: Exact crowd size doesn't affect doctrine
- **Handling**: Use plural (or appropriate large number marker)

### Clusivity + Prayer (Non-Arbitrary)
- **Verse**: Matthew 6:9 "Our Father"
- **Arbitrary**: No
- **Why**: Corporate vs individual prayer theology
- **Handling**: Present inclusive (praying together) and exclusive (teaching others) options

### Clusivity + Travel Narrative (Arbitrary)
- **Verse**: Acts 16:10 "we sought to go to Macedonia"
- **Arbitrary**: Yes
- **Why**: Just indicates narrator joined group
- **Handling**: Use exclusive (narrator + Paul's group, not reader)

---

## Conclusion

This framework ensures that:
1. Theological significance is preserved
2. Translator freedom is respected
3. False teaching is prevented
4. Legitimate diversity is acknowledged
5. Source ambiguity is maintained
6. Cultural perspectives are considered

The goal is not to make theological decisions FOR translators, but to ensure they have the information needed to make informed decisions consistent with their theological tradition while avoiding unintended doctrinal implications.
