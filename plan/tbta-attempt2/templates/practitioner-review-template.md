## Translation Testing Methodology

### Verses Selected for Translation

Selected {5-10} verses from validate set covering:
- Different TBTA values
- Various genres
- Different difficulty levels

**Verses Tested**:
1. {REF}: {TBTA value} - {genre} - {difficulty}
2. {REF}: {TBTA value} - {genre} - {difficulty}
3. {REF}: {TBTA value} - {genre} - {difficulty}
4. {REF}: {TBTA value} - {genre} - {difficulty}
5. {REF}: {TBTA value} - {genre} - {difficulty}

### Translation Process

For each verse:
1. Read source text (Greek/Hebrew)
2. Consult TBTA annotation for {feature}
3. Translate into target language
4. Evaluate: Did TBTA help or hinder?

---

## Translation Results

## Cross-Language Considerations

### For Marking Languages (grammatically encodes {feature})

**Usefulness**: [HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW]
**Reasoning**: {why TBTA is or isn't helpful for languages that mark this feature}

### For Non-Marking Languages (doesn't encode {feature})

**Usefulness**: [HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW]
**Reasoning**: {is TBTA still useful even when language doesn't require explicit marking?}
