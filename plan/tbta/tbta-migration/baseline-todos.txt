bible-study-tools/tbta/features/README.md:1:[TODO: similar to ../tbta-source/TBTA-FEATURES.md and FEATURE-SUMMARY.md but focus on progress.  Not detailed progress which will be on the README for each feature but done/not done checkmark and if not done what stage it is at, what accuracy we can achieve, our definition (which may have diverged from tbta, language families impacted, most significant notes; cannot exceed 200 lines and defers in depth analaysis to teh feature README.md files).  Broken down into our groupings of how features are grouped.  Noting if the feature is original to TBTA, redefined, or NEW)]
bible-study-tools/tbta/features/README.md:3:[TODO: integrate the best from GENERIC-FEATURE-TEMPLATE, stay on point, don't bloat but pull the most helpful into this, ensure it aligns with STAGES.md and it may need to be in it's own file to keep our progressive disclosure skill format]
bible-study-tools/tbta/features/README.md:5:[TODO: incorporate tbta-rebuild-with-llm/features/README.md keeping only the relevant parts consistent with our new structure]
bible-study-tools/tbta/features/README.md:7:[TODO: incoporate FEATURE-AUDIT-TEMPLATE.md after making it current with our latest]
bible-study-tools/tbta/features/README.md:9:[TODO: need to go through each subdir of tbta-rebuild-with-llm/features and copy that dir over to here, standardizing directory names against feature names and groupings, standardizing all the files against our new STAGES.md and feature templates]
bible-study-tools/tbta/languages/README.md:1:[TODO: aggregate, copy, rebuild from tbta-rebuild-with-llm/languages/*]
bible-study-tools/tbta/languages/README.md:2:[TODO: pull in key data (much of which may be obsolete so prefer the above) from tbta-rebuild-with-llm/combined/language-adaptation-guide.md]
bible-study-tools/tbta/learnings/README.md:1:[TODO: incorporate ADVERSARIAL-TESTING.md]
bible-study-tools/tbta/learnings/README.md:2:[TODO: incorporate all files from tbta-rebuild-with-llm/learnings/*, throw away bloat and outdated learnings that don't apply to our new structure]
bible-study-tools/tbta/learnings/README.md:3:[TODO: incorporate CROSS-FEATURE-LEARNINGS.md potentially as own file again throw away bloat and outdated learnings that don't apply to our new structure]
bible-study-tools/tbta/learnings/README.md:4:[TODO: incorporate tbta-rebuild-with-llm/combined/integration-test.md but be highly sceptical as this was not very thouroughly tested despite it's claims, try to pull potential learnings but don't be as confident as they are, more "consider" words or "in some cases" or "explore potential that"]
bible-study-tools/tbta/tbta-source/TBTA-FEATURES.md:1:[TODO: look at FEATURE-CHECKLIST.md and all other files where we analyzed the features, however I don't want a progress/status update instead a list of their features, how they define it, the values they allow.  Foreach value what the definition is and any guidance they have on when to use it.  Coverage.  Concerns we have found of large scale inconsistencies]
bible-study-tools/tbta/tbta-source/CRITIQUE.md:1:[TODO: incorporate tbta-rebuild-with-llm/combined/IMROVEMENTS.md assuming it may be made up or out of date and the experiments done where too early or not well validated, validate and keep the core criticisms]
bible-study-tools/tbta/tbta-source/README.md:1:[TODO: review plan/tbta-analysis.md adding key insights (not all) into the right files of this directory]
bible-study-tools/tbta/tbta-source/README.md:2:[TODO: review plan/tbta-comprehensive-review.md adding key insights (not all) into the right files of this directory]
bible-study-tools/tbta/tbta-source/DATA-STRUCTURE.md:1:[TODO: start with tbta-rebuild-with-llm/tbta-data folder however it is limited in that it is mostly Genesis and not broad enough on the Bible, especially needs to deal with the difference between OT and NT in how it splits files/verses]
bible-study-tools/tbta/structure/README.md:1:[TODO: the experiment at tbta-rebuild-with-llm/combined/reproduction-prompt is poorly tested, overly confident and out of date but may have useful information to get started, be skeptical but validate and bring in the useful information, consider the other files in the directory as well and rightly place them here, or in features or learnings or languages folders relative to ..]
