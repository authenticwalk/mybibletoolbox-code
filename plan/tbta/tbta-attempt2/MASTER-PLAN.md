# TBTA Hive Mind Execution - Attempt 2

**Swarm ID**: swarm-1763257151509-1opbfdko9
**Initialized**: 2025-11-16T01:39:11.525Z
**Status**: Phase 0 Complete → Ready for Phase 1A

---

## Collective Intelligence Summary

### Phase 0: Planning & Research ✅ COMPLETE

**4 Parallel Agents Deployed**:
1. ✅ **Feature Inventory Researcher** - 14 features catalogued
2. ✅ **Learnings Consolidation Researcher** - Top 10 patterns extracted
3. ✅ **Prioritization Analyst** - 3-phase execution plan
4. ✅ **Validation Framework Tester** - Production readiness protocols

### Key Findings

**Current State**: All 14 active features at Stage 0
**Priority**: 10 high-priority, 4 medium-priority features
**Complexity**: 1 low, 4 medium, 6 high, 3 very high

**Top 3 Success Patterns**:
1. Tier 0 Check (explicit encoding first)
2. Translation Validation (95-99% accuracy via consensus)
3. Hierarchical Prompting (60-70% resolution at theological level)

## Phase 1A Execution: Foundation Builders

### Target Features (3)
1. **polarity** - Low complexity, grammatical
2. **person-system** - Medium complexity, translation validation ready
3. **number-system** - Medium complexity, dual/trial number systems

### Strategy
- **Parallel Execution**: 3 feature agents simultaneously
- **Timeline**: 2 weeks per feature
- **Methodology**: Full 6-stage STAGES.md workflow
- **Coordination**: Queen aggregates, synthesizes, ensures quality

## Next Actions

🎯 **Launch Phase 1A Feature Development Agents**
- Each agent receives full context on 6-stage methodology
- Apply reusable patterns from archive
- Follow blind testing protocol
- Report findings to collective memory

**Expected Outcome**: 3 production-ready features in 2-4 weeks
