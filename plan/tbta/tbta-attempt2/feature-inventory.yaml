recommended_development_order:
  # Start with simpler features to build methodology confidence
  phase_1_foundations:
    - polarity          # Simplest; test the 6-stage methodology
    - person-system     # Clear patterns; fundamental
    - number-system     # Well-defined; dual number interesting but not too complex

  # Move to moderate complexity with high impact
  phase_2_core_grammatical:
    - mood              # High priority; Greek mood system well-documented
    - degree            # Moderate complexity; good for building skills
    - time-granularity  # Spatial/temporal baseline
    - proximity-system  # Related to time-granularity

  # Tackle high-complexity discourse features
  phase_3_discourse:
    - illocutionary-force  # Speech acts; high priority
    - topic-np             # Topic-prominent languages critical
    - discourse-genre      # Affects all other features; foundational

  # Most complex features requiring significant prior learning
  phase_4_advanced:
    - aspect                  # Complex but critical; benefits from prior grammatical work
    - participant-tracking    # Very complex discourse-level; needs methodology refinement
    - honorifics-register     # Very complex; extensive archive to leverage
    - surface-realization     # Broad and complex; save for last

next_steps:
  immediate:
    - "Review /workspace/plan/tbta-rebuild-with-llm/README.md for any additional context"
    - "Check features-archive/ for learnings from previous attempts"
    - "Decide: Restart from scratch OR build on archive work"
    - "Select first feature to develop (recommend: polarity or person-system)"

  before_starting_stage_1:
    - "Ensure TBTA source data is accessible (sparse-checkout configured)"
    - "Verify translation data availability (eBible, etc.)"
    - "Set up subagent coordination protocols"
    - "Create experiments/ directory structure"

  methodology_refinements:
    - "Document learnings across features in /workspace/bible-study-tools/tbta/learnings/"
    - "Build reusable scripts for Stage 4 (translation data extraction)"
    - "Create templates for TRANSLATION-PATTERNS.md, DIVERGENCE-ANALYSIS.md, etc."
    - "Establish peer review subagent coordination patterns"

blockers_and_dependencies:
  global_blockers:
    - "Need TBTA source documentation access (check ../tbta-source/README.md)"
    - "Translation data sparse-checkout configuration needed"
    - "Subagent spawning patterns need to be established"

  feature_dependencies:
    - "discourse-genre should inform other discourse features"
    - "aspect and time-granularity may interact"
    - "person-system and honorifics-register overlap"
    - "participant-tracking depends on understanding discourse patterns"

archive_insights:
  honorifics_register:
    - "Extensive prior work: 9 documentation files"
    - "Files: AGE-RELATIONSHIP-GUIDE, ATTITUDE-EXAMPLES, LANGUAGE-APPLICATIONS, LANGUAGE-MATRIX, SPEAKER-DEMOGRAPHICS-README, SPEAKER-LISTENER-CODES, VALIDATION-CHECKLIST"
    - "Suggests very high complexity and significant research already completed"

  surface_realization:
    - "Very large archive (9+ files)"
    - "Broad category; may need subdivision"

  person_system:
    - "Has TODO.md and experiments/ in archive"
    - "Prior work stopped at some stage; review for learnings"

  all_features:
    - "All have README.md in archive suggesting documentation existed"
    - "All have experiments/ directories suggesting data generation attempted"
    - "Previous approach likely didn't follow complete 6-stage methodology"

assessment_notes:
  methodology_status:
    - "6-stage STAGES.md is authoritative and comprehensive"
    - "TEMPLATE.md provides clear structure"
    - "All features reset to Stage 0 with empty experiments/"
    - "Archive contains valuable prior work but methodology was incomplete"

  readiness_to_start:
    - "Documentation is solid (STAGES.md, TEMPLATE.md, README.md)"
    - "Feature directories are prepared with checklists"
    - "Archive provides reference material"
    - "READY: Can start Stage 1 for any feature immediately"

  success_factors:
    - "Strict adherence to 6-stage methodology"
    - "Blind testing with subagents (prevent seeing answers)"
    - "Translation-informed development (dual sources: TBTA + real translations)"
    - "Locked predictions before TBTA checks"
    - "100% accuracy goal with adequate sample sizes (100+ verses)"
    - "4 critical peer reviews before production"

  risk_areas:
    - "Very high complexity features (honorifics, participant-tracking, surface-realization) may require multiple iterations"
    - "Translation data availability may vary by feature"
    - "Subagent coordination overhead could slow progress"
    - "Sample size requirements (100+ per value) may be challenging for rare values"
