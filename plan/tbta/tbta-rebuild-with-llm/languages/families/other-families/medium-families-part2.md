# Medium Language Families - Part 2 (10-24 Languages)

This document covers the second set of medium-sized language families (Tucanoan through Creole).

**Total in this file**: 4 families with 55 languages

---

## 10. Tucanoan (14 languages)

**Languages in dataset**: Barasana-Eduria, Carapana, Cubeo, Macuna, Paicoca, Piratapuyo, Siona, Siriano, Tanimuca-Letuama, Tatuyo, Tucano, Tuyuca, Waimaha, Wanano

**Geographic distribution**: Northwest Amazon (Colombia, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador - Vaupés region)

### Unique Grammatical Features

#### 1. Noun Classification (Source: Oxford Bibliographies)
- Extensive noun classification systems
- Animate/inanimate nouns have clear morphological opposition
- Masculine/feminine gender categories exist

#### 2. Evidentiality (Source: Wikipedia - Tuyuca)
- Particularly well-developed in family
- Tuyuca has FIVE evidentiality paradigms:
  - Visual
  - Nonvisual
  - Apparent
  - Second-hand (past tense only)
  - Assumed (not in 1st person present)
- Evidential affixes also express:
  - Tense (past/present, not future)
  - Person
  - Number
  - Gender

#### 3. Agglutination (Source: Cysouw manuscript)
- Grammatical meanings expressed by agglutinated suffixes

#### 4. Language Similarity (Source: Cysouw)
- High degree of cognate correspondences
- Grammars quite similar across family

#### 5. Areal Diffusion (Source: WALS)
- Evidentiality spread through contact
- Neighboring non-Tucanoan languages adopted similar systems (Vaupés region)

### Translation-Relevant Distinctions

- **Evidential precision**: Five-way evidential distinction requires careful interpretation
- **Gender marking**: Agreement throughout system
- **Evidential-tense fusion**: Evidentiality interacts with tense marking
- **Contact effects**: Evidentiality may appear in neighboring languages through borrowing
- **Translation complexity**: Non-specialists rely on English translations + additional explanations

## 11. Sepik (14 languages)

**Languages in dataset**: Abau, Alamblak, Ambulas, Hanga Hundi, Iatmul, Iwam (Sepik), Kwanga, Kwoma, Manambu, Mende, Saniyo-Hiyewe, Yessan-Mayo

**Geographic distribution**: Papua New Guinea (Sepik River basin and adjoining areas)

### Unique Grammatical Features

#### 1. Simple Phonology (Source: Britannica)
- Few consonants or vowels
- Usually no tones
- Appear to have three-vowel systems: /ɨ ə a/
- Distinguish only vowel height
- High preponderance of central vowels

#### 2. Unusual Vowel Systems (Source: Britannica)
- Many Papuan languages (especially Sepik-Ramu basin) have unusual vowel systems
- Very high use of central vowels

#### 3. Noun Class Systems (Source: Britannica)
- Torricelli, Sepik, Lower Sepik-Ramu have noun class systems
- Up to 10 noun classes
- Each class has specific singular/plural suffixes
- Related adjectives and verbs show concord

#### 4. Complex Verb Morphology (Source: Academia.edu)
- Rich phonological systems
- Diverse grammatical structures
- Complex verb morphology
- Example from Alamblak: mi-brɲi-r = "he went down"
  - Literally: "down + go away + he"

#### 5. Classification Status (Source: Academia-lab)
- Sepik-Ramu hypothesis controversial
- Features like distinctive pronouns may be language area features, not genetic

### Translation-Relevant Distinctions

- **Simple phonology**: Fewer phonemic distinctions than many languages
- **Noun classes**: Correct class assignment affects agreement throughout sentence
- **Verb complexity**: Directional and aspectual meanings incorporated into verb
- **Central vowels**: May be difficult to perceive/transcribe for speakers of languages lacking central vowels

### Sources Consulted

- Wikipedia: Papuan languages, Sepik languages

## 12. Torricelli (12 languages)

**Languages in dataset**: Au, Bukiyip, Kamasau, Kombio, Mufian, Olo, Urat, Urim, Weri

**Geographic distribution**: Papua New Guinea (northern region)

### Unique Grammatical Features

#### 1. SVO Word Order (Source: Wikipedia)
- UNUSUAL among Papuan languages
- Basic clause order: Subject-Verb-Object
- Most Papuan languages have SOV

#### 2. Noun Inflection for Number (Source: Wikipedia)
- Nouns inflected for number
- NOT generally found in:
  - Trans-New Guinea
  - Sepik
  - Lakes Plain
  - West Papuan
  - Alor-Pantar
  - Tor-Kwerba families

#### 3. Complex Noun Class Systems (Source: Britannica)
- Upwards of 10 noun classes
- Most classes assigned phonologically (based on final segment of stem)
- Nouns carry complex inflections marking:
  - Number distinctions
  - Noun classes

#### 4. Grammatical Gender (Source: De Gruyter)
- Gender likely marked at root of Torricelli languages
- Pronouns and verbs at core of system

#### 5. Pronoun Reconstruction (Source: Wikipedia)
- Independent personal pronouns:
  - *ki = "I"
  - *(y)i = "thou"
  - *(y)ip = "you (pl)"
- Second-person pronouns = strong diagnostics for Torricelli membership

#### 6. Unusual Features (Source: ResearchGate - Walman)
- Two words function as noun phrase conjunctions
- Have morphology of transitive verbs
- Exhibit:
  - Subject agreement with first conjunct
  - Object agreement with second conjunct

### Translation-Relevant Distinctions

- **SVO order**: Unlike most Papuan languages, matches English/Romance order
- **Noun classes**: Class assignment affects agreement patterns
- **Number marking**: Obligatory number distinction on nouns
- **Unusual conjunctions**: "And" expressed by verb-like elements with agreement

### Sources Consulted
- Wikipedia: Torricelli languages
- Britannica: "Papuan languages"

## 13. Creole (15 languages)

**Languages in dataset**: Aukan, Belize English Creole, Chavacano, Haitian Creole, Kriol, Lesser Antillean French Creole, Malay (Kupang), Saramaccan, Sea Island English Creole, Sranan Tongo, Tetun Dili, Tok Pisin, Torres Strait Creole

**Geographic distribution**: Global (Caribbean, Pacific, Southeast Asia, South America)

### Unique Grammatical Features

#### 1. Substrate and Superstrate Influence (Source: ResearchGate)
- Substrate = native speakers' source language
- Superstrate = target language speakers compelled to adopt
- Atlantic Creoles: superstrate = European, substrate = African
- Lexical features mainly from Western European lexifiers
- Structural features transferred from West African substrate languages

#### 2. Selective Feature Transmission (Source: Nature.com)
- Creoles reproduce typological features of substrate languages
- Transmission is SELECTIVE:
  - Bound morphology: NOT transferred (too complex)
  - Tonal structures: NOT transferred (paradigmatic complexity)
  - Morphological and tonal systems: simplified in language contact

#### 3. Word Order (Source: Britannica)
- SVO word order most common in pidgins and creoles

#### 4. TMA Marking (Source: Academia.edu)
- Majority express grammatical categories via three preverbal free morphemes
- Order: Tense - Mood - Aspect

#### 5. Simplification Patterns (Source: Nature.com)
- Complex paradigms simplified
- Bound morphology replaced with free morphemes
- Analytic structures preferred over synthetic

### Translation-Relevant Distinctions

- **Mixed ancestry**: Must understand both substrate and superstrate influences
- **Simplified morphology**: Less inflectional complexity than source languages
- **Free morphemes**: Grammatical relations expressed by separate words, not affixes
- **Substrate syntax**: Often preserves word order patterns from substrate
- **Bible translation**: Tok Pisin has Bible translation, indicating creoles are fully developed for religious texts

## Summary

These 4 medium-sized families (14, 14, 12, 15 languages) total 55 languages and exhibit:

- **Evidentiality**: Tucanoan (5-term system in Tuyuca - most elaborate)
- **Simple phonology**: Sepik (three-vowel systems, central vowels)
- **Noun classes**: Sepik (10 classes), Torricelli (10+ classes)
- **Unusual word order**: Torricelli SVO (rare for Papuan), Creole SVO (universal)
