This document covers language families with 5-9 languages in the dataset.

**Total in this file**: 9 families with 61 languages

## 14. Nilo-Saharan (8 languages)

**Languages in dataset**: Bedjond, Dholuo, Dinka (Southwestern), Kenga, Morokodo, Sabaot, Shatt, Uduk

**Geographic distribution**: Central/East Africa (Sudan, South Sudan, Kenya, Uganda, Chad)

### Unique Grammatical Features

#### 1. Tone Systems (Source: Britannica)
- Most languages tonal (2-4 tones)
- Some peripheral varieties lack tones (contact with non-tonal Afro-Asiatic)
- Western Lugbara: up to 4 tonal levels

#### 2. Verb Morphology (Source: ResearchGate)
- Extensive marking for person, number, tense, aspect, voice
- Consonant mutation often accompanies morphological processes
- Widespread perfective/imperfective aspect distinction
- Common verbal features:
  - 1st person singular: prefix a-
  - 2nd person singular: prefix i-
- Person/number marked by verbal prefixes

#### 3. Singulative Marking (Source: ResearchGate)
- Singular marked, plural is basic unmarked form
- Collective nouns marked in singular to single out one item

#### 4. Nominal Case (Source: ResearchGate)
- Case marking widespread but absent in areas contiguous to Niger-Congo
- Cases marked by suffixes or tonal differences

#### 5. Vowel Harmony (Source: ResearchGate)
- Prominent in Central Sudanic, Nilotic, Surmic groups
- Restricts co-occurrence of vowels from more than one harmonic set

### Translation-Relevant Distinctions

- **Tonal variation**: Tone may mark case or other grammatical categories
- **Aspect-oriented**: Perfective/imperfective more important than tense
- **Vowel harmony**: Harmonic sets must be respected in affixation
- **Case systems**: Variable across family

### Translation-Relevant Distinctions

- **Ergativity**: Different case marking than accusative languages
- **Evidential complexity**: Must track both information source and speaker attitude
- **Animacy hierarchy**: Case marking sensitive to animacy
