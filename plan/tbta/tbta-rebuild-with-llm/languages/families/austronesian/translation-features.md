# Translation-Relevant Grammatical Features

This document explores specific translation challenges and strategies for handling Austronesian grammatical features in Bible translation.

## Voice System Translation Challenges

**Challenge**: The symmetrical voice system means that semantic roles (agent, patient, location, instrument) are marked on the VERB rather than through case marking on nouns.

### Biblical Example: John 3:16

**Greek**: *ὁ θεὸς ἠγάπησεν τὸν κόσμον* (God loved the world)
- Greek marks agent (God) with nominative case
- Greek marks patient (world) with accusative case

**Philippine-type translation needs to choose focus**:
- **Actor focus**: Emphasizes God as the one doing the loving
- **Patient focus**: Emphasizes the world as the one being loved
- Choice depends on discourse context (what is old vs. new information)

### General Principle

"Focused noun phrases are definite, or old information, while nonfocused noun phrases may be either definite or indefinite"

**Translation implication**: Translators must track information structure, not just grammatical roles.

## Inclusive/Exclusive Pronouns in Scripture

### Critical Passages

#### 1. The Great Commission (Matthew 28:20)

"And behold, I am with you always" - *you* (plural)

Following "go and make disciples" - does "you" include future disciples or only the immediate apostles?
- **Inclusive** might suggest: "I am with us (you apostles + the nations you'll disciple)"
- **Exclusive** might suggest: "I am with you apostles specifically"

#### 2. Paul's Letters - First Person Plural

**Romans 5:1**: "Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God"
- **Inclusive**: Paul + Roman Christians (both justified)
- **Exclusive**: Paul + apostles (teaching the Romans)

**Ephesians 1:3-14**: Multiple shifts between "we/us/our" and "you"
- Some "we" includes all believers (inclusive)
- Some "we" may refer to apostles/Jewish Christians (exclusive)

#### 3. Narrative Passages

**Acts 16:10**: "God had called us to preach the gospel to them"
- **Exclusive**: Paul, Silas, Timothy, Luke (narrator) - not including the Philippians

**John 1:14**: "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us"
- **Inclusive**: All humanity? All believers? Or
- **Exclusive**: The disciples who witnessed Jesus?

### Translation Decision Framework

1. Identify the speaker/writer
2. Identify the addressee(s)
3. Determine if "we" includes the addressee
4. Check discourse context for information structure

## Realis/Irrealis and Aspect in Narrative

**Challenge**: Greek tense-aspect system (aorist, imperfect, perfect, present) does not map directly to realis/irrealis modal systems.

### Mapping Issues

#### 1. Greek Aorist (Past Events)
- Maps to **realis mood** (event actually happened)
- But aorist also used in conditions, negated events, future projections
- Requires careful analysis of context

#### 2. Greek Present/Imperfect
- Generally **realis** if describing actual ongoing actions
- But present in timeless truths, gnomic statements may vary

#### 3. Greek Future
- Corresponds to **irrealis** (event has not yet happened)
- But prophetic future (especially in OT) may require different treatment

#### 4. Greek Subjunctive/Optative
- Clear **irrealis** (hypothetical, wishes, potential)

### Biblical Examples

#### Matthew 4:3 - Satan tempts Jesus

**Greek**: "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become bread"
- **Condition (protasis)**: Irrealis (hypothetical situation)
- **Command (apodosis)**: Irrealis (potential action)

#### Genesis 1:3 - Creation narrative

**Hebrew**: *wayyiqtol* form (וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים)
- Describes actual past event: **Realis**
- But describes command "Let there be light": Command = **Irrealis**
- **Nested modality**: realis narrative + irrealis command

#### Prophetic Past (Hebrew prophetic perfect)

- Describes future events as if past (prophetic certainty)
- Tension between semantic future (irrealis) and grammatical past (realis)

## Definiteness and Information Structure

**Challenge**: Greek article system encodes both definiteness and anaphoric reference. Austronesian languages use various strategies.

### Philippine-Type Strategy

- **Ang-phrase**: Marks definite/focused noun
- Integrated with voice system
- Information structure primary, definiteness secondary

### Oceanic Strategy

- **Demonstratives** for definiteness
- Often no dedicated articles
- May lack explicit definiteness marking

### Biblical Examples

#### John 1:1 - "In the beginning was the Word"

**Greek**:
- ἐν ἀρχῇ (no article - qualitative?)
- ὁ λόγος (with article - definite)

How to mark definiteness without overusing demonstratives?

#### Generic vs. Specific Nouns

- "A/the prophet" vs. "the Prophet" (John 1:21)
- "A/the king" vs. "the King of kings"
- Definiteness interacts with theological significance

### Translation Principle

- Track whether noun is given/new information (more important than definiteness per se)
- Use focus/voice system to highlight new information
- Reserve demonstratives for true deictic or emphatic uses

## Stative Verbs and Adjectives

**Challenge**: Greek and Hebrew adjectives may correspond to stative verbs in Austronesian.

### Examples

#### Psalm 23:1 - "The LORD is my shepherd"

**Hebrew**: יְהוָה רֹעִי (YHWH + participle/noun)
- Predicate relationship
- In Austronesian: May use stative verb construction or equational sentence

#### Beatitudes (Matthew 5:3-11) - "Blessed are..."

**Greek**: μακάριοι (adjective)

**Hebrew underlying**: אַשְׁרֵי (*'ashre*) - often treated as verbal

**Austronesian**: Likely stative verb "to be blessed/happy"

#### Color Terms

"White as snow" (Isaiah 1:18)
"Red like crimson" (Isaiah 1:18)

If color terms are stative verbs, comparisons may need different constructions

### Translation Principle

- Identify adjectives in source text
- Determine if stative verb is natural in target language
- Adjust syntax accordingly (adjectives can be predicates; stative verbs are predicates)

## Reduplication for Emphasis and Distribution

**Challenge**: Hebrew and Greek use various strategies for emphasis (repetition, intensifying adjectives, superlatives). Austronesian reduplication offers natural equivalents.

### Biblical Examples

#### 1. Hebrew Repetition for Emphasis

"Holy, holy, holy" (Isaiah 6:3) - Already uses repetition
- May translate naturally with or without reduplication depending on system

#### 2. Plural Concepts

"Many waters" (Psalm 93:4)
- **Indonesian**: *air-air* (water-REDUP) = 'waters/bodies of water'

#### 3. Distributive Meaning

"To each according to his work" (Revelation 22:12)
- "Each one" may use Ca-reduplication in some languages

#### 4. Iterative/Habitual Actions

- Greek imperfect tense for repeated past action
- May use reduplication to indicate repetition

### Translation Principle

- Identify semantic functions (plurality, distribution, emphasis, iteration)
- Check if target language uses reduplication for these functions
- Use reduplication where natural, not as word-for-word morphological match

## Possessive Classification and Kinship

**Challenge**: Inalienable vs. alienable possession categories affect how relationships are expressed.

### Inalienable Possession Categories

- **Body parts**: "My body" (1 Corinthians 6:19)
- **Kinship**: "My Father" (Jesus referring to God)
- **Spiritual aspects**: "My soul" (Psalm 23)

### Biblical Implications

#### 1. Kinship Terms for God

"Our Father" (Matthew 6:9) - Inalienable possession
- Implies inherent, unbreakable relationship
- Morphologically marked differently from "our possessions"

#### 2. Body as Temple

1 Corinthians 6:19 - "Your body is a temple"
- **Body** = inalienable
- **Temple** = alienable (or not, depending on spiritual ownership?)
- Creates theological tension that may be grammatically marked

#### 3. Metaphorical Extensions

"The Lord is my shepherd" (Psalm 23:1)
- Shepherd-sheep relationship: Alienable or inalienable?
- May need to adjust based on target language categorization

### Translation Principle

- Identify possessive relationships in source text
- Determine if target language categorizes them as inalienable or alienable
- Use appropriate morphology
- Be aware that categorization may not match source language intuitions

## Causative Constructions

**Challenge**: Causative morphology differs between Melanesian, Polynesian, and other sub-families.

### Patterns

- **Melanesian**: va-, pa-, fa- (alone or with -ka, -ga)
- **Polynesian**: whaka-, faka-

### Biblical Examples

#### 1. Causative Verbs

"Make disciples" (Matthew 28:19) - Causative sense ("cause to be disciples")
- **Greek**: μαθητεύσατε (denominative verb from μαθητής)
- May require explicit causative morphology

#### 2. Hiphil Stems in Hebrew

Hebrew causative (Hiphil) very common in narrative
- "He caused them to pass through" = "He led them through"
- Needs causative prefix in many Austronesian languages

### Translation Principle

- Identify causative semantics in source text
- Use appropriate causative morphology for target language sub-family
- Be aware that some languages may use periphrastic causatives instead
