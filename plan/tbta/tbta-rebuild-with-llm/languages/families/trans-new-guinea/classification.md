# Trans-New Guinea Family Classification

## Overview

The Trans-New Guinea family classification has evolved through several proposals. The most recent comprehensive classification is by Pawley & Hammarström (2018), who accept **35 subgroups** with strong claims to TNG membership. Earlier work by Ross (2005) proposed a more conservative classification based primarily on pronominal evidence.

## The 35 Major Subgroups

Following Pawley & Hammarström (2018):

1. **Angan** - Eastern Highlands, Morobe, and Gulf provinces (~12 languages, ~70,000 speakers)
2. **Anim** - Southern Papua New Guinea
3. **Asmat-Kamoro** - Southern Papua, Indonesia
4. **Awin-Pa** - Western Province, PNG
5. **Bosavi** - Southern Highlands and Western Province, PNG (~6 languages including Kaluli)
6. **Chimbu-Wahgi** (Chimbu) - Chimbu and Simbu provinces (~10 languages)
7. **Dagan** - Western Province, PNG
8. **Dani** - Highlands of Papua, Indonesia (~6 languages, ~250,000 speakers)
9. **Duna-Bogaya** - Hela and Southern Highlands provinces, PNG
10. **East Strickland** - Southern Highlands Province, PNG
11. **Enga-Kewa-Huli** (Engan family) - Enga, Southern Highlands, and Hela provinces (~400,000+ speakers for Enga alone)
12. **Finisterre-Huon** - Huon Peninsula and Finisterre Range (~60-65 languages, ~130,000 speakers)
13. **Gogodala-Suki** - Western Province, PNG
14. **Goilalan** - Central Province, PNG
15. **Greater Awyu** - Papua, Indonesia
16. **Greater Binanderean** (Binandere family) - Oro Province, PNG (~14 languages, ~50,000+ speakers)
17. **Kainantu-Goroka** (Eastern Highlands) - Divided into:
    - Kainantu languages (~4 languages, ~46,000 speakers)
    - Gorokan languages (~8 languages, ~200,000 speakers)
18. **Kayagaric** - Southern Papua
19. **Kiwaian** - Western and Gulf provinces, PNG
20. **Koiarian** - Central Province, PNG
21. **Kolopom** - Southern Papua, Indonesia
22. **Kutubu** (East and West Kutubuan) - Southern Highlands Province, PNG
23. **Kwalean** - Madang Province, PNG
24. **Madang** - Madang Province, PNG (~80+ languages, ~80,000 speakers)
25. **Mailuan** - Central Province, PNG
26. **Manubaran** - Gulf Province, PNG
27. **Mek** - Highlands border region, PNG-Indonesia
28. **Marori** - Southern Papua, Indonesia
29. **Ok-Oksapmin** (Ok family) - Highlands border region, PNG-Indonesia
30. **Paniai Lakes** (Wissel Lakes) - Central Highlands, Papua, Indonesia (~4 languages, ~100,000 speakers)
31. **Somahai** - Papua, Indonesia
32. **Turama-Kikori** - Gulf Province, PNG
33. **West Bomberai** - Papua, Indonesia
34. **Wiru** - Southern Highlands Province, PNG
35. **Yareban** - Central Province, PNG

## Classification Methodology

The classification of Trans-New Guinea languages employs multiple approaches:

### Lexical Comparison
Shared cognates in basic vocabulary form the foundation of genetic relationships. The comparative method identifies systematic sound correspondences across languages.

### Pronominal Paradigms
**Ross (2005)** emphasized pronoun systems as diagnostic features. He proposed a more conservative TNG classification excluding 95 languages without shared pronominal forms. This approach highlights the central role of pronoun paradigms in establishing genetic relationships.

### Verb Morphology
Key diagnostic features include:
- **Object prefixes**: Especially n- for 1sg and velar stops for 2sg
- **Subject suffixes**: Person and number marking
- Pattern: Object-prefix + Verb-root + Subject-suffix

### Computational Phylogenetics
Modern approaches combine traditional comparative method with computational analysis:
- **Greenhill (2015)**: TransNewGuinea.org database with lexical data, cognate sets, and statistical tools
- Phylogenetic trees based on lexical cognacy
- Open-access data for reanalysis and verification

## Proto-Trans-New Guinea Reconstructions

Key reconstructed features from the proto-language (sources: Pawley & Hammarström 2018, pp. 141-146):

### Pronouns

**Core pronouns**:
- *ni "we" (1st person)
- *ŋgi "you" (2nd person)
- *i "they" (3rd person)

**Number suffixes**:
- *-li (dual)
- *-t (dual)
- *-nV (plural: n plus vowel)

**Collective suffixes**:
- *-pi- (dual collective)
- *-m- (plural collective)

### Verbal Morphology

**Object prefixes**:
- *n- (1st person singular object)
- Velar stop (2nd person singular object) [NEEDS SOURCE for specific reconstruction]

**Subject suffixes**: [NEEDS SOURCE for specific proto-forms]

### Negation

Two widespread forms suggesting proto-TNG origins:
- *ma (negation)
- *na (negation)

These forms appear across multiple subgroups, supporting deep genetic relationship.

## Notes on Classification Disputes

The boundaries of Trans-New Guinea remain somewhat controversial:

1. **Conservative approach (Ross 2005)**: Excludes languages without clear pronominal evidence
2. **Expansive approach (Pawley & Hammarström 2018)**: Includes 35 subgroups with varying levels of evidence
3. **Ongoing research**: Computational phylogenetics continues to refine understanding

Some language groups (e.g., Angan, Binandere) have disputed membership in different classifications. The 35-subgroup classification represents current consensus but should be understood as a working hypothesis subject to revision.
