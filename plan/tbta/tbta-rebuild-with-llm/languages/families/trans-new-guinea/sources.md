## Recommendations for Further Research

### Priority Areas Needing Sources

1. **Possessive class systems**: Verify exact counts for Amele, Anêm, Mussau
2. **Morphological complexity**: Source specific examples of polysynthetic (Mian, Telefol) vs. isolating (Kimaghama) languages
3. **TAM systems**: Detailed descriptions of multiple past tense paradigms
4. **Sub-family features**: Individual grammars for languages in dataset
5. **Dialectal variation**: Documentation of variation within languages

### Unpublished/Limited-Access Sources

Many languages in the dataset likely have:
- SIL International linguistic notes (not always publicly accessible)
- Wycliffe Associates translation notes
- Unpublished PhD dissertations
- Conference presentations
- Fieldwork reports

These should be consulted for comprehensive language-specific information.
