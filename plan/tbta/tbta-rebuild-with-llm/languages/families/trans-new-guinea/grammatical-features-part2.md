## 7. Evidentiality

**The New Guinea Highlands Evidentiality Area**: A concentrated region where grammatical evidentiality is highly developed.

### 7.1 Geographic Distribution

**Languages with grammaticized evidentiality** (at least 14 identified):
- Ok-Oksapmin family
- Duna-Bogaya family
- Engan family
- East and West Kutubuan families
- Bosavi family (including Kaluli)

**Note**: Most languages on New Guinea island *lack* grammatical evidentiality, making this a remarkable areal feature.

### 7.2 Evidential Categories Attested

1. **Participatory**: Direct personal experience/involvement (underexplored category)
2. **Visual**: Direct visual evidence
3. **Sensory** (non-visual): Auditory, tactile, olfactory evidence
4. **Inferential**: Evidence from results/effects
5. **Reasoning**: Logical deduction
6. **Reportive**: Hearsay/reported information
7. **Factual**: Known facts (some languages)

### 7.3 Morphological Strategies

- **Verbal inflection**: Suffix-based systems
- **Clitics**: Separate grammatical elements
- **Particles**: Free-standing markers
- Systems range from one marked category to five+ categories

### 7.4 Interaction with Other Categories

- **Egophoricity**: Some languages (e.g., Kaluli) show egophoric marking interacting with person
- **Tense**: Double tense systems allow specifying both event time and evidence acquisition time
- **Person marking**: First vs. non-first person may affect evidential choice

**Translation implications**:
- **Critical for translation**: Evidential systems require marking information source
- Old Testament prophetic literature: requires marking of divine revelation
- Gospel narratives: eyewitness vs. reported events need distinct marking
- Epistles: distinguishing Paul's firsthand experience from transmitted teaching
- May require adding explicit evidential information not in source text
- Quotations and reported speech require careful evidential marking

**Example**: Fasu has visual evidential marked by the circumfix a-...-re (e.g., a-pe-re '[I see] it is coming')

**Source**: Loeweke, Eunice & Jean May. 1980. *General Grammar of Fasu (Namo Me)*. (for Fasu evidential)

## 8. Negation

**Common patterns**:
- Negation typically marked by **verb prefix** or **proclitic**
- Two widespread forms suggesting proto-TNG origins:
  - **mV-** forms (*ma reconstructed)
  - **nV-** forms (*na reconstructed)

**Proto-Trans-New Guinea**: *ma- and *na

**Translation implications**:
- Negative commands (prohibitions) may have distinct forms
- Double negatives may not work as in Greek
- Scope of negation may differ from source languages

## 9. Spatial Deixis and Directional Systems

**Elevation-based systems**: A major areal feature of TNG and broader New Guinea/Oceania

**Topographic orientation**:
- **Uphill** vs. **Downhill** distinctions grammaticalized
- Vertically-oriented spatial systems reflecting mountainous environment
- Direction of motion verbs marked for elevation change

### Examples

**Yupno** (Finisterre mountains, ~8,000 speakers):
- Motion verbs distinguish level vs. up vs. down movement
- **Temporal metaphor**: Uphill = future, Downhill = past
- Environment-based absolute frame of reference

**Source**: Cooperrider, Kensy, James Slotta & Rafael Núñez. 2017. "Uphill and Downhill in a Flat World: The Conceptual Topography of the Yupno House." *Cognitive Science* 41: 768-799.

**Wano** (~7,000 speakers, Papua):
- Four spatial dimensions in elevative deictics:
  1. Steepness vs. non-steepness
  2. Proximity vs. distality
  3. Adverbial vs. attributive
  4. Vertical plane

**Source**: Burung, Willem. "Deixis in Wano."

**Translation implications**:
- Directional motion ("go up to Jerusalem," "come down from the mountain") maps naturally
- Vertical spatial metaphors in Scripture align with TNG systems
- "Ascension" and "descension" language highly relevant
- May require specifying elevation change in motion verbs
- Hebrew *'alah* (go up) and *yarad* (go down) find natural equivalents

## 10. Possession

### 10.1 Alienable vs. Inalienable Distinction

Present in many TNG languages

**Inalienably possessed categories** (typically):
- Body parts
- Kinship terms
- Cultural relationships
- Experiential events

**Example**: **Wano** distinguishes alienable/inalienable by:
- Nominal generalization patterns
- Lexical forms
- Plurality coding differences
- Possessive construction types
- Head-role in clauses

**Source**: Burung, Willem. "Alienable and Inalienable Nouns in Wano."

### 10.2 Extensive Possessive Classifier Systems

- **Amele** (Madang): 32 classes (31 suffix allomorphy classes + 1 postposition class)
- **Anêm**: 20+ classes (based on stem-final suffix and possessive suffix allomorphy)
- **Mussau-Emira**: 9+ classes (indirect possessive construction with classifiers)

**Translation implications**:
- Kinship terms require inalienable constructions
- Body part metaphors must use inalienable possession
- "Son of God" likely requires kinship possession
- Possessive pronouns may require classifier choice
- Metaphorical possession ("my people," "your faith") needs appropriate marking

## 11. Information Structure and Discourse

### 11.1 Topic Marking

**Strategies**:
- Dedicated topic particles
- Demonstrative-based topic markers (e.g., Wambon)
- Gender/case/number marked topic markers (e.g., Nalca/Mek languages)

**Function**: Marks discourse topics, often clause-initial

**Note**: Detailed documentation of specific topic marking strategies requires consultation of individual language grammars

### 11.2 Discourse Prominence and Ergativity

**Yali** (and others): Optional ergative marking operates at:
- Global discourse level (text-level prominence)
- Local discourse level (clause-level focus)
- Interaction between ergative and discourse prominence

### 11.3 Ellipsis

- Discourse often highly elliptical
- Verbal morphology provides cohesion signals
- Switch-reference and person marking track participants through elliptical clauses

**Translation implications**:
- Topic-comment structures may differ from Greek/Hebrew
- Fronting and focusing mechanisms important for emphasis
- Ellipsis patterns may allow dropping explicit subjects/objects
- Important for maintaining discourse coherence in translation

## 12. Quotative Constructions

**Complexity**: TNG languages show sophisticated quotation systems

### Direct vs. Indirect Speech

**Usan example**:
- **Direct speech**: Mono-perspectival (speaker's viewpoint only)
- **Indirect speech**: Bi-perspectival (speaker + quoted person's viewpoint)
- Grammaticalized quotative verb: *qamb* 'say.SS' (same-subject medial form)
- *qamb* exclusively used for "inner speech" and indirect quotes
- Direct speech stretches can embed within indirect quote frame

**Source**: Reesink, Ger P. "Usan quotatives."

### Integration with Clause Chaining

- Quotative verbs integrate into medial/final verb system
- Switch-reference tracks quotation boundaries
- Reported speech in clause chains maintains participant tracking

**Translation implications**:
- **Extensive quotation in Scripture**: Requires systematic quotative strategies
- Old Testament: Extensive direct speech from God, prophets, narrative characters
- Gospels: Jesus's teaching and dialogue
- Epistles: Embedded quotations from OT
- May require explicit quotative markers beyond source text punctuation
- Indirect discourse may be preferred/required in some contexts
- Perspective marking essential for clarity

## 13. Additional Features

### 13.1 Reflexive and Reciprocal

- Limited comprehensive data available across the family
- Reciprocals grammaticalized in some languages (e.g., Mountain Ok languages)
- Further research needed for systematic cross-linguistic description

### 13.2 Question Formation

- Yes/no questions and content questions use different strategies
- Some languages have been studied: Duna ('where' questions with spatial deixis), various question particles
- Further research needed for comprehensive family-wide description

### 13.3 Compounding

- Both N-N and V-V compounding productive
- Clear categorial divide between nouns and verbs typically maintained
