# Evidentiality in Bible Translation Languages

## Translation Impact ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (CRITICAL)

**Impact Level**: CRITICAL - OBLIGATORY in ~50 Trans-New Guinea Highlands languages + Quechuan + Tucanoan + others (~100+ languages total)

**Why This Matters**:
- **Theological Accuracy**: "Jesus rose from the dead" - witnessed by apostles or reported tradition?
- **Gospel Authority**: Eyewitness testimony vs. hearsay affects credibility
- **Prophetic Speech**: Divine revelation requires special evidential marking
- **Translation Decisions**: Every statement requires explicit information source in obligatory languages

**Criticality**: HIGHEST - Wrong evidential choice can undermine Gospel authenticity or misrepresent apostolic witness

---

## Executive Summary

Evidentiality is a grammatical category marking the **source of information** for a statement. Languages with obligatory evidentiality require speakers to specify whether they saw/heard/inferred/were told about an event - translators cannot avoid this decision.

Biblical source languages (Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek) do NOT mark evidentiality grammatically. Translators must infer from context.

## Complete Value Enumeration

### Core Evidential Categories

1. **Visual (Direct)** - Speaker witnessed event directly
   - Biblical: "We have seen his glory" (John 1:14)
   - Requires: Eyewitness testimony, firsthand observation

2. **Reportive (Hearsay)** - Speaker heard from others
   - Biblical: Traditional narratives, "They say that..."
   - Requires: Secondhand information, quoted speech

3. **Inferential (Deduced)** - Speaker infers from evidence
   - Biblical: "Someone has taken the Lord" (John 20:2 - based on empty tomb)
   - Requires: Logical deduction, evidence-based conclusions

4. **Participatory** - Speaker participated in event
   - Biblical: "We were with him on the holy mountain" (2 Pet 1:18)
   - Requires: First-person involvement, direct participation

5. **Divine Revelation** - Information from God (special category)
   - Biblical: Prophetic utterances, "Thus says the LORD"
   - Requires: Prophetic or divine source marking

### Language-Specific Systems

**Trans-New Guinea (typical 3-way)**:
- Visual: Saw it happen
- Non-visual sensory: Heard it happen
- Reportive: Was told about it

**Quechua (3-way)**:
- -mi (direct evidence)
- -si (reportive/hearsay)
- -chá (inferential/conjecture)

**Tucano (5-way - most complex)**:
- Visual
- Non-visual sensory
- Apparent (seems to be)
- Secondhand
- Assumed

## Biblical Translation Implications

### Critical Decision Points

#### 1. Gospel Narratives - Eyewitness vs. Report

**John 1:14** - "We have seen his glory"
- **Evidential**: VISUAL (direct witness)
- Apostolic eyewitness testimony
- Critical for Gospel credibility

**Luke 1:1-2** - "Those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses"
- **Evidential**: VISUAL (for witnesses) → REPORTIVE (for Luke writing)
- Luke distinguishes: witnesses (visual) → Luke (reportive from witnesses)

**John 20:25** - "Unless I see... I will not believe"
- **Evidential**: VISUAL required (Thomas demands direct evidence)
- Contrast: Other disciples had visual evidence, Thomas had reportive

#### 2. Resurrection Accounts - Source Matters

**1 Corinthians 15:3-8** - "He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve..."
- **Paul's evidential**: REPORTIVE (for appearances to others)
- **Paul's evidential**: VISUAL (for appearance to Paul himself, v. 8)
- Critical distinction: Paul separates what he was told from what he saw

**Mark 16:6** - "He has risen; he is not here"
- **Angel's evidential**: VISUAL (angel knows directly)
- **Women's evidential**: REPORTIVE (from angel) → VISUAL (empty tomb)
- **Disciples' evidential**: REPORTIVE (from women) until they see

#### 3. Prophetic Literature - Divine Revelation

**Isaiah 6:1** - "I saw the Lord"
- **Evidential**: VISUAL (direct visionary experience)
- But supernatural vision, not ordinary sight

**Ezekiel 1:1** - "The heavens were opened and I saw visions of God"
- **Evidential**: VISUAL (visionary)
- May require special divine-revelation evidential

**"Thus says the LORD"** (throughout prophets)
- **Evidential**: DIVINE REVELATION
- Not visual, reportive, or inferential - special category
- Some languages have dedicated prophetic evidential

#### 4. Old Testament Narrative - Narrative Convention

**Genesis 1:1** - "In the beginning God created"
- **Evidential**: REPORTIVE (traditional narrative)
- No human witness, passed down tradition
- Or DIVINE REVELATION if considered divinely revealed

**Exodus 14:21-22** - "The LORD drove back the sea"
- **Evidential**: VISUAL (for Israelites present)
- But narrator wasn't there: REPORTIVE (traditional account)

#### 5. Epistolary Literature - Paul's Knowledge

**Galatians 1:11-12** - "I did not receive it from man... but through revelation"
- **Evidential**: DIVINE REVELATION
- Paul distinguishes: not REPORTIVE (from humans), but divine source

**1 Thessalonians 4:15** - "We tell you by the word of the Lord"
- **Evidential**: DIVINE REVELATION
- Not Paul's inference or human teaching

## Translation Decision Framework

### Step 1: Identify Source of Information

**Questions to ask**:
1. Who is the original source of this information?
2. How did the speaker/writer learn this?
3. Was the speaker present at the event?
4. Is this firsthand, secondhand, or inferred knowledge?

### Step 2: Determine Evidential Category

**Decision tree**:
- Speaker was there and saw/heard → **VISUAL** or **PARTICIPATORY**
- Speaker was told by others → **REPORTIVE**
- Speaker deduces from evidence → **INFERENTIAL**
- Speaker received divine revelation → **DIVINE REVELATION** (if language has it)
- Traditional narrative, no witness → **REPORTIVE** (traditional)

### Step 3: Handle Theological Complexity

**Special cases**:
- **Divine omniscience**: God's statements aren't "visual" in human sense
- **Inspired Scripture**: Is biblical text DIVINE REVELATION or REPORTIVE?
- **Faith statements**: "Jesus is Lord" - evidential for creedal affirmation?
- **Prophetic perfect**: Future events described as past (evidential ambiguity)

### Step 4: Consistency Within Passage

**Maintain consistency**:
- Same narrator → same evidential throughout pericope
- Perspective shifts → evidential shifts
- Quoted speech → may have different evidential than narrative frame

## Common Prediction Errors

**Error 1**: Treating all narrative as REPORTIVE
- **Problem**: Misses eyewitness testimony in Gospels
- **Solution**: Distinguish apostolic eyewitness (VISUAL/PARTICIPATORY) from traditional narrative

**Error 2**: Missing evidential shifts within passages
- **Problem**: 1 Cor 15 - Paul switches from REPORTIVE (others' testimony) to VISUAL (his own)
- **Solution**: Track speaker knowledge for each clause

**Error 3**: Unclear handling of divine speech
- **Problem**: "God said" - what evidential for God's own speech?
- **Solution**: May use DIVINE REVELATION or special category; consult native speakers

**Error 4**: Confusing inference with report
- **Problem**: "They must have stolen the body" (Matt 28:13)
- **Solution**: This is INFERENTIAL (false inference), not REPORTIVE

## Language-Specific Considerations

### Trans-New Guinea Languages

**See**: [../../languages/families/trans-new-guinea/translation-guide.md](../../languages/families/trans-new-guinea/translation-guide.md)

**Key features**:
- Evidentiality obligatory in ~14 Highlands families
- Typically 2-3 way systems
- Gospel narratives: Eyewitness testimony requires VISUAL evidential
- Prophetic literature: May have special divine-source marking
- Old Testament history: Traditional REPORTIVE

### Quechuan Languages

**System**: -mi (direct) / -si (reportive) / -chá (inferential)

**Biblical application**:
- Apostolic testimony: -mi (direct)
- Traditional OT narrative: -si (reportive)
- Wisdom inferences: -chá (inferential)
- Theological debate: Which evidential for creedal statements?

---

## Translation Quality Checkpoints

1. **Gospel Eyewitness**: Are apostolic eyewitness accounts marked VISUAL/PARTICIPATORY?
2. **Resurrection**: Does resurrection testimony use strongest evidential (visual witness)?
3. **Prophecy**: Is divine revelation distinguished from human report/inference?
4. **Narrative Consistency**: Does evidential match narrator's position (present or not)?
5. **Perspective Shifts**: Do evidentials change when speaker changes (dialogue vs. narration)?

---

## Theological Implications

### Gospel Credibility

- **Evidentiality strengthens Gospel witness**: Obligatory visual evidentials underscore apostolic eyewitness
- **1 John 1:1-3**: "What we have heard, seen, touched" - evidential precision matches original intent

### Prophetic Authority

- **Divine revelation category**: Languages with it naturally distinguish "Thus says the LORD"
- **Visionary experiences**: Special evidentials for supernatural seeing

### Faith and Certainty

- **Evidentials don't encode truth**: Even false statements require evidentials
- **Hearsay evidential ≠ doubt**: REPORTIVE doesn't mean unreliable, just indirect
- **Direct evidential ≠ infallible**: VISUAL can be mistaken
