## Predicted Performance by Category

### Category 1: Prayer/Lament (Expected: 95%+ accuracy)

**Prediction**: All 25 verses → EXCLUSIVE
**Reasoning**: Rule 2.1 (Speech TO deity) has highest priority and applies to all
**Confidence**: Very high - this is algorithm's strongest pattern
**Expected correct**: 24-25/25 (96-100%)

### Category 2: Invitation/Exhortation (Expected: 80-85% accuracy)

**Prediction**: 17 INCLUSIVE, 6 EXCLUSIVE, 2 N/A
**Reasoning**: Rule 2.5a/2.5b split tested extensively
**Confidence**: High - semantic distinction validated on Luke 24:29
**Expected correct**: 19-21/25 (76-84%)

**Potential issues**:
- Isaiah 2:3, 2:5 (pilgrimage could be joining community)
- Revelation 22:17 (complex participatory chain)

### Category 3: Quoted Speech (Expected: 72-80% accuracy)

**Prediction**: 22 EXCLUSIVE, 3 INCLUSIVE
**Reasoning**: Rule 2.7 (outsider quoting) is new and less validated
**Confidence**: Medium - only 21-verse test validation
**Expected correct**: 18-20/25 (72-80%)

**Potential issues**:
- Divine quotation patterns (does God count as "outsider"?)
- Multi-level nested quotes
- Song of Solomon speaker boundaries

### Category 4: Role/Authority/Groups (Expected: 80-85% accuracy)

**Prediction**: 11 EXCLUSIVE, 14 INCLUSIVE
**Reasoning**: Rules 3.1-3.3 well-tested, but some ambiguity
**Confidence**: High for shared experience, medium for authority
**Expected correct**: 20-21/25 (80-84%)

**Potential issues**:
- Apostolic "we" ambiguity in epistles
- Ethnic boundary crossings in Paul's letters

## Key Patterns Observed

### Strong Patterns (95%+ confidence)

1. **Direct prayer TO God** → EXCLUSIVE (Rule 2.1)
   - 22/25 prayer/lament verses at 95% confidence
   - Overrides shared experience in corporate lament

2. **"Let us [verb]" joint action** → INCLUSIVE (Rule 2.5a)
   - 11/15 at 85-95% confidence
   - Clear semantic pattern from Luke 24:29 fix

3. **Shared salvation/baptism experience** → INCLUSIVE (Rule 3.1)
   - 9/14 epistles at 85-95% confidence
   - Paul consistently includes self with readers

### Moderate Patterns (80-90% confidence)

4. **Apostolic witness testimony** → EXCLUSIVE (Rule 3.3/2.6)
   - 6/8 at 85-95% confidence
   - "We declare...you receive" pattern clear

5. **"With/to us" invitations** → EXCLUSIVE (Rule 2.5b)
   - 6/6 at 80-90% confidence
   - Luke 24:29 validated this split

### Uncertain Patterns (70-80% confidence)

6. **Outsider quoting in-group** → EXCLUSIVE (Rule 2.7)
   - 5/5 at 70-85% confidence
   - NEW rule, limited validation

7. **Ethnic boundaries** → MIXED (Rule 3.2)
   - 8/8 at 70-85% confidence
   - Context-dependent (unity vs identity assertions)

## Prediction Locking Protocol

1. ✅ Predictions made WITHOUT accessing:
   - Tagalog translations
   - Indonesian translations
   - Any other clusivity-marking languages
   - TBTA annotations

2. ✅ Algorithm v2.1 applied systematically:
   - Hierarchical rule application
   - Proper priority ordering (Rule 2.1 first)
   - Confidence calibration based on 21-verse validation

3. ✅ Predictions locked via git commit:
   - No modifications allowed after this commit
   - Commit SHA will serve as immutable timestamp
   - Any validation discrepancies will be analyzed as algorithm errors

---

## Validation Plan

### Phase 1: Batch Validation (Parallel)

Use 4 parallel agents to validate 25 verses each:
- Agent 1: Category 1 (Prayer/Lament)
- Agent 2: Category 2 (Invitation/Exhortation)
- Agent 3: Category 3 (Quoted Speech)
- Agent 4: Category 4 (Role/Authority/Groups)

### Phase 2: Compilation

1. Compile all validation results
2. Calculate accuracy by category
3. Calculate overall accuracy
4. Identify error patterns

### Phase 3: Decision

**If accuracy ≥ 80%**:
- ✅ Algorithm v2.1 APPROVED for production
- Document final performance metrics
- Update feature status to COMPLETE

**If accuracy 75-79%**:
- ⚠️ Close to threshold, analyze errors
- If systematic pattern found → iterate to v2.2
- If translation variation → acceptable with documentation

**If accuracy <75%**:
- ❌ Systematic issues identified
- Iterate to v2.2 with fixes
- Re-test on same 100 verses

---

## Expected Outcome

Based on v2.1's 90% performance on 21-verse set and 100% on adversarial subset, expecting **82-87% accuracy** on this 100-verse adversarial set.

**Confidence**: HIGH that production threshold (80%) will be met or exceeded.
