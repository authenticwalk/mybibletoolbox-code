  notes: |
    CRITICAL FINDING: Random test FAILED target (50-60% vs 80-90% expected).
    This suggests either:
    1. Overfitting to training data
    2. Training set not representative of typical cases
    3. Algorithm has systematic blind spots
    4. Random sample happened to be harder than expected

    Algorithm v2.1 projected to fix issues and reach 75-80%, but UNTESTED.

    Need to:
    1. Analyze the 5 failed random test cases
    2. Test algorithm v2.1 on this test set
    3. Investigate why random test performed below adversarial
    4. Consider expanding random sample size
