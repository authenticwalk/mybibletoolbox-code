# Voice Systems (Austronesian Symmetrical Voice)

## Translation Impact ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (CRITICAL)

**Impact Level**: CRITICAL - OBLIGATORY in Philippine-type languages (~40+ languages), important in Western Austronesian (~136 languages)

**Why This Matters**:
- **Every Verb Requires Decision**: Actor focus vs. patient focus vs. location focus vs. instrument focus
- **Information Structure**: Voice marks topic/focus, not just grammatical relations
- **Discourse Coherence**: Voice choice affects what's old vs. new information
- **Non-European Pattern**: Completely different from active/passive voice in Indo-European

**Criticality**: HIGHEST for Philippine languages - voice is obligatory, not optional

---

## Executive Summary

Austronesian languages (especially Philippine-type) have **symmetrical voice systems** where voice marking on the verb indicates which argument is the **topic/focus** of the clause. This is fundamentally different from European active/passive voice.

**Key difference**:
- **European**: Active = agent subject; Passive = patient subject
- **Philippine**: Voice marks which argument is FOCUSED/TOPICAL (can be agent, patient, location, instrument, etc.)

Biblical Greek/Hebrew do not mark this distinction. Translators must determine information structure for every verb.

## Complete Value Enumeration

### Philippine-Type Voice Systems (4-Voice Obligatory)

1. **Actor Voice (AV)** - Agent/actor is focused
   - **Greek example**: "God loved the world" (John 3:16)
   - **When to use**: Agent is topic/focus (old information or emphasized)
   - **Filipino (Tagalog)**: mag-, -um-, maN- affixes

2. **Patient Voice (PV)** - Patient/theme is focused
   - **Greek example**: "The world was loved by God"
   - **When to use**: Patient is topic/focus (what action is done to)
   - **Filipino (Tagalog)**: -in, i- affixes

3. **Location Voice (LV)** - Location/goal is focused
   - **Greek example**: "The place where God showed love"
   - **When to use**: Location is topic/focus (where action occurs)
   - **Filipino (Tagalog)**: -an affix

4. **Instrument Voice (IV)** - Instrument/beneficiary is focused
   - **Greek example**: "The way by which God loved"
   - **When to use**: Instrument/means/beneficiary is topic/focus
   - **Filipino (Tagalog)**: i- affix (different from PV i-)

### Western Austronesian (2-Voice Systems)

**Indonesian/Malay**:
1. **Actor Voice**: Active construction (agent-focused)
2. **Patient Voice**: Passive-like construction (patient-focused)

**Simpler** than Philippine type, closer to European active/passive, but still marks focus/topic differently

## Biblical Translation Implications

### Critical Decision Points

#### 1. John 3:16 - "God loved the world"

**Greek**: ὁ θεὸς ἠγάπησεν τὸν κόσμον
- θεὸς (God) = nominative (agent)
- κόσμον (world) = accusative (patient)

**Voice decision**:
- **Actor Voice**: If God is FOCUS → "The-one-who-loves is God, [whom he loves is] the world"
  - Use when: Emphasizing WHO loves (God, not others)
  - Information structure: God = new/emphasized information

- **Patient Voice**: If world is FOCUS → "The-one-loved is the world, [by whom] God"
  - Use when: Emphasizing WHAT is loved (the world, not just Israel)
  - Information structure: World = new/emphasized information

**Translation strategy**:
- Check discourse context
- Is "God" or "world" the topic being discussed?
- Is this introducing God's love (God = focus) or extent of love (world = focus)?

**Theological implications**:
- Actor voice: Emphasizes God as lover (Trinitarian focus)
- Patient voice: Emphasizes universal scope (world, not just Jews)
- **BOTH are accurate** - choice depends on information structure, not theology

#### 2. Matthew 28:19 - "Go and make disciples"

**Greek**: μαθητεύσατε πάντα τὰ ἔθνη
- Imperative verb (make disciples)
- Object: "all nations"

**Voice decision**:
- **Actor Voice**: If disciples/apostles are FOCUS → "You are the ones to disciple all nations"
  - Emphasizes WHO does the discipling (the apostles)

- **Patient Voice**: If nations are FOCUS → "All nations are to be discipled [by you]"
  - Emphasizes WHO is discipled (all nations, universal scope)

**Context analysis**:
- If previous discourse about apostolic authority → Actor Voice
- If previous discourse about universal mission → Patient Voice

#### 3. Luke 5:1-3 - Location Voice Example

**Greek**: "Jesus stood by the lake... got into one of the boats... taught from the boat"

**Location Voice applicable**:
- "The lake was stood-by [by Jesus]" → LOCATION FOCUS
- "The boat was taught-from [by Jesus]" → LOCATION FOCUS

**When to use**:
- If location is topic (discourse about lake/boat locations)
- If location is contrastive (this lake, not another)

**Greek doesn't mark this** - translator must infer from discourse context

#### 4. Instrument Voice - Less Common

**Example**: John 19:1 - "Pilate took Jesus and flogged him"

**Instrument focus** (if applicable):
- "The-instrument-used-for-flogging was [what Pilate used]"
- Rare, but available if instrument is topical

More common for:
- "The word by which God created" (word = instrument focus)
- "The way by which we are saved" (way/means = instrument focus)

## Translation Decision Framework

### Step 1: Identify All Arguments

**For each verb, identify**:
1. Agent/Actor: Who does the action?
2. Patient/Theme: What/whom is the action done to?
3. Location/Goal: Where does action occur?
4. Instrument/Means: How/with what is action done?

### Step 2: Determine Information Structure

**Questions**:
- Which argument is TOPIC (known/given information)?
- Which argument is FOCUS (new/emphasized information)?
- Which argument is CONTRASTIVE (this, not that)?

**General principle** (from Austronesian literature):
- **Focused noun phrases** = definite, old information, topics
- **Non-focused noun phrases** = may be indefinite or new information

### Step 3: Select Voice

**Decision tree**:
- Agent is topic/focus → **Actor Voice**
- Patient is topic/focus → **Patient Voice**
- Location is topic/focus → **Location Voice**
- Instrument is topic/focus → **Instrument Voice**

### Step 4: Verify Discourse Coherence

**Check**:
- Does voice choice match discourse topic?
- Is there voice consistency within pericope?
- Do voice switches signal topic shifts?

## Common Prediction Errors

**Error 1**: Assuming Actor Voice = Greek Active always
- **Problem**: Greek active can map to any voice depending on focus
- **Solution**: Check information structure, not just Greek voice

**Error 2**: Overusing Patient Voice (like English passive)
- **Problem**: Patient Voice ≠ Greek passive
- **Solution**: Patient voice is about focus, not de-emphasizing agent

**Error 3**: Ignoring Location/Instrument voices
- **Problem**: Assuming only Actor/Patient binary like European languages
- **Solution**: Check if location or instrument is topical/focused

**Error 4**: Inconsistent voice within pericope
- **Problem**: Switching voices randomly without discourse motivation
- **Solution**: Maintain voice unless topic shifts

---

## Information Structure and Voice

### Discourse Topic

**Topic** = what the discourse is about
- Maintained across multiple clauses
- Usually definite/known
- Often subject of multiple verbs

**Voice tracks topic**:
- If God is topic throughout passage → Actor Voice for God's actions
- If patient is topic throughout → Patient Voice for actions on patient

### Contrastive Focus

**Example**: "God loved the world, not just Israel"
- **Contrastive patient** → Patient Voice emphasizes "world"

**Example**: "God loved the world, not Satan"
- **Contrastive actor** → Actor Voice emphasizes "God"

### Given vs. New Information

**Given information** (old, known):
- Typically focused (Voice-marked argument)
- Definite NPs

**New information** (new to discourse):
- Typically non-focused
- May be indefinite

**Example**: "A man came to Jesus"
- First mention of man → "man" is NEW → non-focused
- Jesus is KNOWN → focused → Actor or Patient Voice depending on role

## Language-Specific Patterns

### Tagalog (Philippine-Type)

**See**: [../../languages/families/austronesian/translation-features.md](../../languages/families/austronesian/translation-features.md)

**Affixes**:
- Actor Voice: mag-, -um-, maN-
- Patient Voice: -in, -an (with object focus)
- Location Voice: -an (with location focus)
- Instrument Voice: i-, ipag-

**ang-phrase** marks focused argument (definite/topic)

### Indonesian/Malay (Western Austronesian)

**Simpler system**:
- Active Voice (meN- prefix): Actor-focused
- Passive Voice (di- prefix): Patient-focused

**Closer to European active/passive** but still marks topic/focus

**Information structure still matters**:
- Active ≠ just "agent does action"
- Passive ≠ just "patient receives action"
- Choice based on discourse topic

## Interaction with Other Features

### 1. Participant Tracking

Voice choice affects participant tracking:
- Focused argument = main participant being tracked
- Non-focused arguments may be ellipsed (dropped)

### 2. Definiteness

Voice interacts with definiteness:
- Focused arguments = usually definite
- Non-focused = may be indefinite

### 3. Case Marking

Philippine languages:
- Focused NP: marked with ang (nominative marker)
- Non-focused agent: marked with ng
- Non-focused non-agent: various markers

Voice + case marking = argument structure

## Translation Quality Checkpoints

1. **Voice Obligatoriness**: Is voice marked on every verb?
2. **Information Structure**: Does voice choice match topic/focus?
3. **Discourse Coherence**: Is voice consistent with discourse topic?
4. **Argument Identification**: Are all arguments correctly identified?
5. **Semantic Accuracy**: Does voice choice preserve Greek/Hebrew meaning?

---

## Theological Implications

### Emphasis and Focus

Voice allows theological emphasis:
- **Actor Voice** on God → emphasizes divine agency
- **Patient Voice** on humans → emphasizes human reception of grace
- Both accurate, different emphases

### Universal Scope

- **Patient Voice** + "all nations" = emphasis on universality
- **Actor Voice** + "God" = emphasis on divine initiative

### Example: Ephesians 2:8

**Greek**: "For by grace you have been saved through faith"

**Voice options**:
- **Patient Voice**: "You are the ones saved [by grace through faith]"
  - Emphasizes recipients (you)
- **Instrument Voice**: "Grace/faith is the instrument by which [you are saved]"
  - Emphasizes means

**Both theologically accurate**, different information structure
