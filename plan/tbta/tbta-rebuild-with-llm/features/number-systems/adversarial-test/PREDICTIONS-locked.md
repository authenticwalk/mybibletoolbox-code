## Algorithm v1.0 Summary

Applied patterns from training (experiment-001):

1. **Semantic Over Morphological**: Count entities semantically ("How many X?")
2. **Theological Context**: Trinity contexts = Trial + First Inclusive
3. **Discourse Role**: Same entity, different roles = different numbers
4. **Fossilized Forms**: shamayim, mayim → always Singular
5. **Ancient Translations**: LXX/Vulgate for ambiguous cases

## Predictions

### 1. Genesis 41:40 - "My People" (עַמִּי)

**Verse**: "All my people shall order themselves as you command"
**Constituent**: עַמִּי (ammi) "my people"

**Morphology**: Singular noun with first singular suffix
**Semantics**: Collective - refers to many individuals as one group

**Algorithm application**:
- Pattern 1: Semantic over morphological
- Question: "How many people groups?" Answer: One
- Training parallel: shamayim (dual morphology) → Singular (one sky)
- "My people" = one collective entity, not counting individuals

**Prediction**: **Singular**
**Confidence**: Medium (could be Plural if TBTA counts individuals not collective)
**Alternative**: Plural (if semantic = many persons)

---

### 2. Matthew 3:16 - "Heavens" (οἱ οὐρανοί)

**Verse**: "The heavens were opened to him"
**Constituent**: οἱ οὐρανοί (hoi ouranoi) "the heavens"

**Morphology**: Nominative plural with plural article and plural verb
**Semantics**: Sky/heaven (one cosmic realm)

**Algorithm application**:
- Pattern 1: Semantic over morphological
- Pattern 4: Fossilized form - shamayim → Singular (from training)
- Training: Gen 1:1 shamayim → Singular (LXX uses singular οὐρανόν)
- But here: Greek uses PLURAL οὐρανοί with plural verb
- Conflict: training pattern vs. Greek morphology

**Prediction**: **Singular**
**Confidence**: Low (Greek plural morphology might override training pattern)
**Reasoning**: Following training: "heaven" = semantically one entity
**Alternative**: Plural (following Greek morphology)

---

### 3. Genesis 22:6 - "Both of Them" (שְׁנֵיהֶם)

**Verse**: "And they went both of them together"
**Constituent**: שְׁנֵיהֶם (shneihem) "both of them"

**Morphology**: Dual pronoun (שְׁנֵי "two" + dual suffix)
**Semantics**: Explicitly two persons (Abraham and Isaac)

**Algorithm application**:
- Pattern 1: Semantic matches morphological
- Explicit "both" = exactly 2
- Clear dual context

**Prediction**: **Dual**
**Confidence**: High

---

### 4. Exodus 4:11 - "Blind" (עִוֵּר)

**Verse**: "Who makes him mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind?"
**Constituent**: עִוֵּר (iver) "blind"

**Morphology**: Singular adjective
**Semantics**: State/condition of blindness (affects two eyes but not counting them)

**Algorithm application**:
- Pattern 1: Semantic over morphological
- Question: "How many blind persons?" Answer: One (singular)
- Not counting body parts (eyes), marking the person's state
- No explicit reference to eyes in text

**Prediction**: **Singular**
**Confidence**: High

---

### 5. Matthew 28:19 - Trinity Baptismal Formula

**Verse**: "Baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit"
**Constituent**: Father, Son, Holy Spirit (three persons)
**Note**: "name" is singular; we're marking the three persons

**Morphology**: Three separate persons listed with καὶ (and)
**Semantics**: Trinity - three persons of one Godhead

**Algorithm application**:
- Pattern 2: Theological context - Trinity = Trial + First Inclusive
- Training: Gen 1:26 "Let us make" → Trial (Trinity)
- Three persons explicitly listed: Father, Son, Holy Spirit

**Prediction**: **Trial**
**Confidence**: Medium (assuming we mark the persons, not the singular "name")
**Note**: If marking "name" specifically, would be Singular

---

### 6. 1 John 5:7-8 - "Three That Bear Witness" (τρεῖς)

**Verse**: "For there are three that testify"
**Constituent**: τρεῖς (treis) "three" (Spirit, water, blood)

**Morphology**: Explicit numeral "three"
**Semantics**: Three witnesses, but NOT Trinity (not divine persons)

**Algorithm application**:
- Pattern 2 says Trinity = Trial
- Question: Does Trial extend to all explicit "three" or only Trinity?
- Training focused on theological Trinity contexts
- This is NOT Trinity (Spirit, water, blood are symbols/witnesses, not persons of Godhead)

**Prediction**: **Plural**
**Confidence**: Low (uncertain if Trial is Trinity-specific or all groups of three)
**Reasoning**: Trial likely reserved for Trinity theological contexts
**Alternative**: Trial (if explicit "three" always gets Trial)

---

### 7. Revelation 4:6 - "Four Living Creatures" (τέσσαρα ζῷα)

**Verse**: "Four living creatures"
**Constituent**: τέσσαρα ζῷα (tessara zōa) "four creatures"

**Morphology**: Explicit numeral "four"
**Semantics**: Four distinct beings

**Algorithm application**:
- No training on Quadrial
- Question: Does Quadrial exist in TBTA system?
- Pattern 2 showed Trial for Trinity (theological special case)
- No similar theological special case for "four"
- Likely defaults to Plural or Paucal (small group)

**Prediction**: **Plural**
**Confidence**: Low (Quadrial might exist but no training evidence)
**Alternative**: Paucal (small specific group) or Quadrial (if exists)

---

### 8. Ezekiel 1:5 - "Four Living Creatures" (אַרְבַּע חַיּוֹת)

**Verse**: "The likeness of four living creatures"
**Constituent**: אַרְבַּע חַיּוֹת (arba chayot) "four creatures"

**Morphology**: Explicit numeral "four"
**Semantics**: Four distinct beings (OT parallel to Rev 4:6)

**Algorithm application**:
- Same reasoning as Rev 4:6
- No training on Quadrial
- Likely defaults to Plural

**Prediction**: **Plural**
**Confidence**: Low
**Alternative**: Paucal or Quadrial

---

### 9. Mark 6:38 - "Five Loaves" (πέντε ἄρτους)

**Verse**: "Five loaves and two fish"
**Constituent**: πέντε ἄρτους (pente artous) "five loaves"

**Morphology**: Explicit numeral "five" + plural noun
**Semantics**: Five distinct loaves (small specific number)

**Algorithm application**:
- No training on Paucal
- Question: Where is paucal boundary? (typically 3-10 or 3-15)
- Five is small but more than trial
- No clear guidance from training

**Prediction**: **Plural**
**Confidence**: Low (safe default; paucal boundary unknown)
**Alternative**: Paucal (if 5 falls within paucal range)

---

### 10. Acts 1:15 - "About 120 Persons" (ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι)

**Verse**: "The company of persons was in all about 120"
**Constituent**: ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι (hekaton eikosi) "120"

**Morphology**: Large specific number
**Semantics**: Many persons (too large for paucal)

**Algorithm application**:
- Pattern 1: Semantic count
- 120 >> any paucal range
- Clear plural

**Prediction**: **Plural**
**Confidence**: High

---

### 11. John 11:50 - "The Whole Nation" (ὅλον τὸ ἔθνος)

**Verse**: "The whole nation"
**Constituent**: τὸ ἔθνος (to ethnos) "nation"

**Morphology**: Neuter singular
**Semantics**: Collective - one nation comprising many people

**Algorithm application**:
- Pattern 1: Semantic over morphological
- Question: "How many nations?" Answer: One
- Training parallel: shamayim → Singular (one sky, even with dual morphology)
- "The nation" = one collective entity
- "Whole" emphasizes totality but still one nation

**Prediction**: **Singular**
**Confidence**: Medium-High
**Reasoning**: Training established counting entities, not members

---

### 12. Matthew 4:19 - "Fishers of Men" (ἀνθρώπων)

**Verse**: "I will make you fishers of men"
**Constituent**: ἀνθρώπων (anthrōpōn) "of men"

**Morphology**: Genitive plural
**Semantics**: Mankind/people (generic reference to many)

**Algorithm application**:
- Clear plural morphology
- Semantically many persons
- No ambiguity

**Prediction**: **Plural**
**Confidence**: High

## Confidence Distribution

- **High confidence** (4 predictions): Gen 22:6, Exod 4:11, Acts 1:15, Matt 4:19
- **Medium-High confidence** (1 prediction): John 11:50
- **Medium confidence** (2 predictions): Gen 41:40, Matt 28:19
- **Low confidence** (5 predictions): Matt 3:16, 1 John 5:7-8, Rev 4:6, Ezek 1:5, Mark 6:38

---

## Expected Accuracy

**Target**: 60-70% (7-8 correct out of 12)

**Likely errors**:
- Matt 3:16 (heavens) - Greek morphology might override semantic
- 1 John 5:7-8 (three) - Trial vs. Plural uncertain
- Rev 4:6, Ezek 1:5 (four) - Quadrial might exist or default to Paucal
- Mark 6:38 (five) - Paucal boundary unclear

**High confidence predictions should succeed**: 4/4 = 100%
**Medium+ confidence predictions**: 7 total, expect 5-6 correct = 71-86%
**Overall target**: 7-8 correct = 58-67% ✅

---

## Key Uncertainties

1. **Rare values**: Trial beyond Trinity? Quadrial existence? Paucal boundary?
2. **Collective nouns**: "My people", "nation" - mark collective or members?
3. **Morphology conflicts**: Greek plural "heavens" vs. semantic singular
4. **Theological marking**: Trinity-specific or extends to all explicit three/four?
