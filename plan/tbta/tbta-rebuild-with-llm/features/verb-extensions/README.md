# Verb Extensions (Bantu)

**Status:** Documentation complete
**TBTA Relevance:** High - affects ~60 Bantu languages in Niger-Congo family
**Greek/Hebrew:** Not grammaticalized - these meanings expressed through separate verbs, constructions

## Overview

Bantu verb extensions are verbal suffixes that modify the meaning of the verb root, creating derived verb stems. Extensions add arguments, change valency, or modify the action's relationship to participants. These highly productive morphological processes are absent from Greek and Hebrew, which express similar meanings through syntax or separate lexical items.

## Core Extension Types

### 1. Causative Extension
**Suffix:** `-sha`, `-za`, `-ya` (varies by language)
**Function:** "Make/cause someone to do X"
**Valency:** Increases by one (adds causee argument)

**Swahili example:**
- Root: `pika` (cook)
- Causative: `pikisha` (cause to cook, make someone cook)

### 2. Applicative Extension
**Suffix:** `-ia`, `-lia`, `-ea` (varies)
**Function:** "Do X for/to/at someone/something" (benefactive, instrumental, locative)
**Valency:** Increases by one (adds beneficiary/location/instrument)

**Swahili example:**
- Root: `pika` (cook)
- Applicative: `pikia` (cook for someone)

### 3. Reciprocal Extension
**Suffix:** `-ana`, `-na` (varies)
**Function:** "Do X to each other" (mutual action)
**Valency:** Subject becomes plural, object removed

**Swahili example:**
- Root: `pika` (cook)
- Reciprocal: `pikana` (cook for each other)

### 4. Passive Extension
**Suffix:** `-wa`, `-wa` (consistent across Bantu)
**Function:** "Be X-ed" (patient becomes subject)
**Valency:** Decreases by one (agent demoted)

**Swahili example:**
- Root: `pika` (cook)
- Passive: `pikwa` (be cooked)

### 5. Stative Extension
**Suffix:** `-ika`, `-aka`, `-eka` (varies)
**Function:** "Be in a state of being X-able or X-ed"
**Valency:** Intransitive, describes state

**Swahili example:**
- Root: `pika` (cook)
- Stative: `pikika` (be cookable)

### 6. Reversive Extension
**Suffix:** `-ua`, `-oa`, `-ola` (varies)
**Function:** "Un-do X, reverse X"
**Valency:** Same as base

**Swahili example:**
- `funga` (close/tie)
- `fungua` (open/untie, undo closing)

## Stacking Extensions

**Extensions can combine:**

**Swahili example:**
- Root: `pika` (cook)
- Causative + reciprocal: `pikishiana` (cause each other to cook)
- Causative + applicative: `pikishia` (cause to cook for someone)
- Applicative + passive: `pikiwa` (be cooked for)

**Up to 3-4 extensions** can stack in some cases, creating complex semantic derivations.

## Biblical Translation Examples

### Causative Constructions

**Matthew 5:45 - "He causes his sun to rise"**
- Greek: ἀνατέλλει τὸν ἥλιον (makes-rise the sun)
- Bantu: rise-**CAUSATIVE**
- Single verb with causative extension

**Mark 4:39 - "He rebuked... and said, 'Be still!'"**
- Greek: ἐπετίμησεν... σιώπα (rebuked... be-silent)
- Bantu: be.silent-**CAUSATIVE** (make silent, silence)

**2 Corinthians 3:6 - "He has made us competent"**
- Greek: ἱκάνωσεν (made-sufficient)
- Bantu: be.competent-**CAUSATIVE**

### Applicative (Benefactive) Constructions

**Mark 1:40-41 - "Jesus healed him"**
- Greek: ἐκαθαρίσθη (was-cleansed)
- Bantu: heal-**APPLICATIVE** (heal-for-him)
- Extension emphasizes action done for beneficiary

**John 19:23 - "The soldiers... took his clothes"**
- Greek: ἔλαβον τὰ ἱμάτια (took the clothes)
- Bantu: take-**APPLICATIVE** (take-for-themselves)
- Benefactive extension shows self-benefit

**Luke 10:34 - "He bandaged his wounds"**
- Greek: κατέδησεν τὰ τραύματα (bound the wounds)
- Bantu: bind-**APPLICATIVE** (bind-for-him)

### Reciprocal Constructions

**John 13:34 - "Love one another"**
- Greek: ἀγαπᾶτε ἀλλήλους (love one-another-ACC)
- Bantu: love-**RECIPROCAL**
- Single verb expresses mutual action
- Very natural in Bantu!

**1 Corinthians 11:33 - "Wait for one another"**
- Greek: ἀλλήλους ἐκδέχεσθε (one-another wait-for)
- Bantu: wait-**RECIPROCAL**

**Ephesians 4:32 - "Forgiving one another"**

- Bantu: forgive-**RECIPROCAL**

**Romans 12:10 - "Love one another... honor one another"**
- Greek: τῇ φιλαδελφίᾳ... τῇ τιμῇ ἀλλήλους (in-love... in-honor one-another)
- Bantu: love-**RECIPROCAL**, honor-**RECIPROCAL**
- Natural, concise expression

### Passive Constructions

**Matthew 1:20 - "What is conceived in her"**
- Greek: τὸ... γεννηθὲν (the-thing-having-been-born)
- Bantu: conceive-**PASSIVE**
- Direct mapping to passive extension

**Ephesians 2:8 - "You have been saved"**
- Greek: ἐστε σεσῳσμένοι (are having-been-saved)
- Bantu: save-**PASSIVE**
- Perfect passive maps well

**John 3:16 - "That whoever believes... should not perish"**
- Greek: μὴ ἀπόληται (not perish-SUBJ)
- Bantu: perish-**PASSIVE** (be destroyed)

### Stative Extension

**Luke 5:36 - "The new will not match the old"**
- Greek: οὐ συμφωνήσει (not will-agree)
- Bantu: match-**STATIVE** (be matchable)
- Expresses state/potentiality

### Reversive Extension

**Mark 1:10 - "He saw heaven being torn open"**
- Greek: σχιζομένους τοὺς οὐρανούς (being-torn the heavens)
- Bantu: close-**REVERSIVE** (undo closing, open)

**John 11:44 - "Unbind him"**
- Greek: λύσατε αὐτὸν (loose him)
- Bantu: bind-**REVERSIVE** (undo binding)

## Stacking in Translation

**Complex biblical actions can use multiple extensions:**

**"He went to heal them" (implied benefactive + motion):**
- Potential: go-**APPLICATIVE** + heal-**APPLICATIVE**
- Or: heal-**APPLICATIVE-CAUSATIVE** (cause healing for them)

**"They taught one another":**
- teach-**RECIPROCAL-APPLICATIVE** (teach-each.other-for.benefit)

**"Be reconciled to one another" (2 Corinthians 5:18-20):**
- reconcile-**RECIPROCAL** (natural expression of mutual reconciliation)

## Theological Implications

### Benefactive Theology

**Applicative extension emphasizes benefit:**
- "Christ died for us" = die-**APPLICATIVE**-us
- Extension grammatically marks "for us" benefit
- Makes substitutionary atonement linguistically explicit

**"God so loved the world":**
- love-**APPLICATIVE** (love for the benefit of)
- Extension can emphasize God's love is "for" humanity

### Community and Reciprocity

**Reciprocal extension natural for "one another" commands:**
- NT has 100+ "one another" (ἀλλήλους) commands
- Bantu reciprocal extension = concise, natural expression
- Emphasizes mutuality of Christian community

**Examples:**
- Love one another → love-**RECIPROCAL**
- Forgive one another → forgive-**RECIPROCAL**
- Serve one another → serve-**RECIPROCAL**
- Bear one another's burdens → bear-**RECIPROCAL**

### Causative Divine Action

**God's causative agency:**
- "God causes all things to work together" (Romans 8:28)
- work-**CAUSATIVE** (make work, cause to work)
- Emphasizes God's active causing

**"He who began a good work in you" (Philippians 1:6):**
- begin-**CAUSATIVE** (cause to begin)

## Cultural Variations

### Benefactive Emphasis

**African communal cultures:**
- Applicative extension reflects community-oriented action
- Actions inherently understood as benefiting others
- Theological fit: Christianity's emphasis on love/service

### Reciprocity Values

**Traditional African reciprocity:**
- Reciprocal extension aligns with cultural values
- Christian "one another" commands culturally resonant
- Mutual aid, shared burden naturally expressed

## Interaction with Other TBTA Features

### With Voice
- Passive extension = passive voice
- Maps directly to Greek passive
- But morphological, not periphrastic

### With Valency/Semantic Roles
- Extensions add or remove arguments
- Causative: adds causee
- Applicative: adds beneficiary/location/instrument
- Reciprocal: removes object, makes subject plural
- Passive: removes agent, promotes patient

### With Participant Tracking
- Extensions affect who is doing what to whom
- Benefactive: adds beneficiary participant
- Reciprocal: subjects act on each other

## Data Requirements for TBTA

### Per-Verb Annotation

For each verb, annotate potential extensions:
1. **Causative:** Is agent causing someone else to act?
2. **Applicative:** Is there a beneficiary/recipient/location?
3. **Reciprocal:** Is action mutual between plural subjects?
4. **Passive:** Is patient the subject?
5. **Stative:** Does it describe a state or potentiality?

### Greek Construction Mapping

**Greek constructions that map to extensions:**
- ἀλλήλους (one another) → Reciprocal
- Passive voice → Passive extension
- Benefactive dative → Applicative extension
- Causative verbs → Causative extension
- Potential constructions → Stative extension

### Stacking Guidance

**When multiple extensions apply:**
- Document most common stacking orders
- Some orders are more natural than others
- Language-specific constraints on stacking

## Variants by Language

### Bantu (60+ languages)
**Highly productive across Bantu:**
- All major extensions present
- Stacking possible (2-4 extensions)
- Some variation in suffix forms
- Core system very consistent

**Swahili:** Well-documented, productive system

**Other Bantu:** Similar patterns with phonological variation

### Non-Bantu Niger-Congo
**Other Niger-Congo sub-families:**
- May use different strategies (serial verbs, periphrasis)
- Verb extensions less productive or absent
- Mande, Kru, Ijoid: different systems

## Research Gaps

1. **Comprehensive mapping** of NT Greek constructions to Bantu extensions
2. **Stacking order preferences** for biblical contexts
3. **Theological terminology:** Do Bantu translations create new patterns?
4. **Cross-linguistic variation:** How do different Bantu languages handle same passages?
5. **Semantic overlap:** When do extensions overlap with other constructions?

## Recommendations

### For TBTA Annotation

1. **Mark all constructions mappable to extensions**
   - Causatives, benefactives, reciprocals, passives
   - Even when Greek uses different strategies

2. **Flag "one another" commands**
   - 100+ in NT
   - Natural reciprocal extension use

3. **Note benefactive implications**
   - Dative of advantage/disadvantage
   - Substitutionary actions

### For Tool Development

1. **Automatic extension suggestion**
   - Based on Greek voice, construction, semantics
   - Reciprocal trigger: ἀλλήλους
   - Passive trigger: Greek passive voice
   - Benefactive trigger: dative of advantage

2. **Stacking predictor**
   - When multiple extensions apply
   - Suggest natural order

3. **Community decision tracker**
   - How did translators handle ambiguous cases?
   - Document patterns

### For Translation Practice

1. **Leverage extensions for natural expression**
   - Don't create periphrastic equivalents when extension suffices
   - Single verb with extension more natural than multi-word phrase

2. **Reciprocal extension for community**
   - "One another" commands = reciprocal extension
   - Emphasizes mutuality

3. **Benefactive theology**
   - Use applicative extension for substitutionary actions
   - "For us" benefit grammatically marked

4. **Consistency**
   - Same Greek construction → same extension type
   - Unless context requires variation
