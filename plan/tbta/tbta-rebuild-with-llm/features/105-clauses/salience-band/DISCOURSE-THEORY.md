# Discourse Theory: Salience Band Foundations

This document provides the linguistic theoretical foundations for the Salience Band feature, drawing on 40+ years of discourse analysis research.

## Core Concept: Foreground vs Background

The fundamental insight: **Not all clauses in discourse are equal**. Some clauses advance the main storyline (foreground), while others provide supporting information (background).

This distinction is:
- **Universal** across languages (though encoded differently)
- **Gradient** (not binary: multiple levels of prominence)
- **Genre-dependent** (narrative has clearer foreground than exposition)
- **Grammatically encoded** in many languages (especially verb morphology)

## Hopper & Thompson (1980): Foregrounding in Narrative

**Seminal work**: "Transitivity in Grammar and Discourse" (Language 56:251-299)

### Key Claims

1. **Foreground clauses** form the narrative backbone:
   - Temporally sequential
   - Punctual events (not states)
   - High transitivity (agent acts on patient)
   - Perfective/aorist aspect
   - Realis mood

2. **Background clauses** provide supportive information:
   - Simultaneous or durative
   - Stative verbs
   - Lower transitivity
   - Imperfective aspect
   - Irrealis mood

### Transitivity Parameters

Hopper & Thompson proposed **10 parameters** that correlate with foreground/background:

| Parameter | Foreground (High) | Background (Low) |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Participants** | 2+ (A and O) | 1 (S only) |
| **Kinesis** | Action | State/Process |
| **Aspect** | Telic | Atelic |
| **Punctuality** | Punctual | Durative |
| **Volitionality** | Volitional | Non-volitional |
| **Affirmation** | Affirmative | Negative |
| **Mode** | Realis | Irrealis |
| **Agency** | High agency | Low agency |
| **Object affectedness** | Totally affected | Partially affected |
| **Object individuation** | Individuated | Non-individuated |

**Application to Salience Band**:
- **Primary salience** → High transitivity (6+ parameters)
- **Secondary salience** → Medium transitivity (4-5 parameters)
- **Background salience** → Low transitivity (2-3 parameters)

### Biblical Examples

**High transitivity (Primary salience)**:
- "Jesus healed the man" (2 participants, action, telic, volitional, affected object)

**Low transitivity (Background salience)**:
- "The man was blind" (1 participant, state, atelic, non-volitional)

## Longacre (1990s): Narrative Peak and Prominence

**Key work**: *The Grammar of Discourse* (1996, Plenum Press)

### Discourse Profile Theory

Longacre identified **4 discourse types** with different prominence structures:

| Type | Foreground | Background | Peak Strategy |
|------|------------|------------|---------------|
| **Narrative** | Event line | Setting, evaluation | Dramatic peak (climax) |
| **Procedural** | Command sequence | Purpose, background | No peak |
| **Expository** | Main points | Support, evidence | Thesis statement |
| **Hortatory** | Exhortations | Reasons, grounds | Appeal climax |

### Peak Identification

**Peak features** (Pivotal salience):
1. Rhetorical underlining (repetition, paraphrase)
2. Concentration of participants
3. Heightened vividness (direct speech, onomatopoeia)
4. Change of pace (shift in tempo)
5. Change of vantage point (shift in perspective)
6. Crowding of tense/aspect shifts

**Biblical example** (Genesis 22:10-12, Binding of Isaac):
- Concentration: Abraham, Isaac, angel all present
- Vividness: Direct speech "Abraham! Abraham!"
- Underlining: Name repetition (urgency)
- **Salience**: Pivotal (narrative climax)

### Verb Rank in Narrative

Longacre proposed **4 ranks** of verb prominence in narrative:

| Rank | Function | Salience Band |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **1. Mainline** | Sequential backbone | Primary |
| **2. Supportive** | Elaboration on mainline | Secondary |
| **3. Backgrounded** | Setting, circumstance | Background |
| **4. Irrealis** | Negation, hypothetical | Background |

**Application**: Maps directly to Primary → Secondary → Background salience.

## Givón (1984): Discourse Grounding

**Key work**: *Syntax: A Functional-Typological Introduction* (Vol 1, Benjamins)

### Grounding Hierarchy

Givón expanded foreground/background into a **gradient scale**:

```
FOREGROUND
  ├─ Main event line (sequential, perfective)
  ├─ Supportive event line (elaborative)
  └─ Descriptive backgrounding (durative, stative)
BACKGROUND
  ├─ Generic backgrounding (timeless)
  └─ Irrealis backgrounding (hypothetical)
```

**Mapping to Salience Band**:
- Main event line → **Primary** salience
- Supportive event line → **Secondary** salience
- Descriptive backgrounding → **Background** salience
- Generic backgrounding → **Background** (generic statements)

### Continuity Metrics

Givón proposed measuring discourse continuity:
1. **Referential distance**: Clauses since last mention (participant tracking)
2. **Potential interference**: Competing referents (ambiguity)
3. **Persistence**: Clauses until next mention (importance)

**Relevance to Salience**:
- Foreground (Primary) → Low referential distance, high persistence
- Background → Can have gaps, lower persistence

## Levinsohn (2015): Greek NT Discourse Features

**Key work**: *Discourse Features of New Testament Greek* (3rd ed, SIL)

### Greek Foreground/Background Markers

Levinsohn analyzed how **Greek grammaticalizes salience**:

| Greek Feature | Discourse Function | Salience Band |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Aorist indicative** (main clause) | Mainline events | Primary |
| **Historic present** | Vivid foreground | Pivotal/Primary |
| **Imperfect** | Durative background | Background |
| **Perfect** | Resultant state | Background |
| **Genitive absolute** | Circumstantial frame | Background/Setting |
| **Participle (adverbial)** | Backgrounded action | Secondary/Background |
| **Subordinate clause** | Backgrounded information | Background (usually) |

### Participant Reference and Salience

**Pattern**: Foreground clauses use full NPs; background allows pronouns/zero.

**Exception**: Pivotal moments may use full NP even for continuous referent (marking importance).

**Biblical example** (Mark 1:9-11, Jesus' baptism):
```
v9: "Jesus came from Nazareth" (aorist, full NP, mainline)
v10: "Coming up (participle), he saw..." (background temporal + mainline)
v11: "Voice came from heaven" (aorist, new participant, Pivotal)
```

**Salience**: v11 is **Pivotal** (theophany, narrative peak), not just Primary.

## Dooley & Levinsohn (2001): Analyzing Discourse (SIL)

**Key work**: *Analyzing Discourse: A Manual of Basic Concepts* (SIL)

### Four-Level Prominence System

Practical framework for Bible translators:

| Level | Function | Example | Salience Band |
|-------|----------|---------|---------------|
| **Level 1: Peak** | Climactic events | "Let there be light!" | Pivotal |
| **Level 2: Event line** | Sequential mainline | "God saw... God separated" | Primary |
| **Level 3: Supporting** | Elaboration, consequence | "God called it Day" | Secondary |
| **Level 4: Background** | Setting, circumstance | "Earth was formless" | Background |

### Translation Decisions

**Critical insight**: Target language foreground/background marking may differ from source.

**Example (Swahili)**:
- English: "When Jesus saw the crowd, he went up the mountain"
  - Both subordinate syntax
- Swahili: "Yesu alipowaona watu, akapanda mlima"
  - First: -li- past (background temporal)
  - Second: -ka- narrative (foreground mainline)

**Lesson**: Salience annotation must be **discourse-based**, not syntax-based.

## Hopper (1979): Aspect and Foregrounding

**Key work**: "Aspect and Foregrounding in Discourse" (in *Discourse and Syntax*, Academic Press)

### Aspect as Grounding Device

**Core claim**: Aspect (not tense) is the primary grammatical device for marking foreground/background.

| Aspect | Discourse Function | Example |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| **Perfective** | Foreground (bounded events) | "He ate the bread" |
| **Imperfective** | Background (unbounded states) | "He was hungry" |
| **Perfect** | Background (resultant state) | "He had eaten already" |

**Cross-linguistic evidence**:
- **Greek**: Aorist (foreground) vs Imperfect (background)
- **Hebrew**: Wayyiqtol (foreground) vs Qatal (background)
- **Swahili**: -ka- (foreground) vs -ki- (background)
- **English**: Simple past (foreground) vs Past progressive (background)

### Narrative Example (English)

```
"John entered the room (foreground: perfective).
 Mary was sitting by the window (background: imperfective).
 She had been waiting for hours (background: pluperfect).
 'Where have you been?' she asked (foreground: perfective)."
```

**Salience mapping**:
- "entered" → Primary (mainline event)
- "was sitting" → Background (durative state)
- "had been waiting" → Background (anterior state)
- "asked" → Primary (mainline event)

## Fleischman (1990): Tense and Narrativity

**Key work**: *Tense and Narrativity: From Medieval Performance to Modern Fiction* (University of Texas Press)

### Narrative Foreground Tense (NFT)

**Observation**: Languages have a **dedicated narrative tense** for foreground events.

**Examples**:
- **French**: Passé simple (literary narrative past)
- **Swahili**: -ka- consecutive
- **Hebrew**: Wayyiqtol
- **Russian**: Perfective past

**Function**: Marks sequential mainline events in narrative discourse.

**Salience Band**: These forms almost always indicate **Primary** salience.

### Background Tenses

**Background tense inventory**:
1. **Imperfect**: Durative, habitual ("he was going", "he used to go")
2. **Pluperfect**: Anterior, flashback ("he had gone")
3. **Present**: Historic present (vivid foreground) OR generic (timeless background)

## Dry (1981, 1983): The Movement of Narrative Time

**Key insight**: **Foreground clauses advance narrative time; background clauses do not.**

### Time Movement Test

**Question**: Does this clause move the story forward in time?

- **YES** → Foreground (Primary/Secondary salience)
- **NO** → Background (Background/Setting salience)

**Example** (John 9:1):
```
"As Jesus passed by (temporal frame: NO time advance)
 he saw a man blind from birth (initiating event: YES time advance)
 who was blind from birth (descriptive background: NO time advance)"
```

**Salience**:
- "passed by" → Background (temporal setting)
- "saw" → Primary (mainline event, advances time)
- "was blind" → Background (descriptive state)

### Exceptions

**Pivotal moments may not advance time** but still receive high prominence:

Example: "Then God said, 'Let there be light'"
- Time movement: Minimal (speech act)
- Salience: **Pivotal** (turning point, first creative word)

**Lesson**: Time movement correlates with salience but doesn't determine it alone.

## Labov (1972): Narrative Clause Types

**Key work**: *Language in the Inner City* (University of Pennsylvania Press)

### Six Clause Types in Narrative

| Type | Function | Salience Band |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **Abstract** | Summary preview | Setting |
| **Orientation** | Who, what, when, where | Background/Setting |
| **Complicating action** | Main events | Primary |
| **Evaluation** | So what? Why telling? | Secondary |
| **Resolution** | Outcome | Primary |
| **Coda** | Return to present | Setting |

**Application to Biblical narrative**:
- Gospel pericopes often begin with **Orientation** (time, place)
- **Complicating action** = Primary salience
- **Evaluation** (e.g., "This amazed everyone") = Secondary
- **Resolution** (healing completed, person responds) = Primary

## Integration: Five-Level Salience System

Drawing on all theories above, TBTA uses **5 salience bands**:

### 1. Pivotal (Longacre's Peak + Labov's Resolution)
- Narrative climax, turning point
- Concentrated participants, rhetorical underlining
- Hopper: Extreme transitivity
- Example: "Let there be light!" (GEN 1:3)

### 2. Primary (Hopper/Longacre Mainline + Givón Event Line)
- Sequential foreground events
- Perfective aspect, high transitivity
- Advances narrative time
- Example: "God separated light from darkness" (GEN 1:4)

### 3. Secondary (Longacre Supportive + Givón Elaborative)
- Elaboration on mainline
- Consequences, results of primary events
- Medium transitivity
- Example: "God called the light Day" (GEN 1:5)

### 4. Background (Hopper/Givón Background + Longacre Backgrounded)
- Setting, circumstance, durative states
- Imperfective aspect, low transitivity
- Does not advance narrative time
- Example: "The earth was formless and void" (GEN 1:2)

### 5. Setting (Labov Orientation + Longacre Scene)
- Discourse frame, temporal anchor
- Introduces new scene/paragraph
- Example: "In the beginning God created..." (GEN 1:1)

## Genre Variation

Different genres show different prominence patterns:

### Narrative (Genesis, Gospels, Acts)
- Clear foreground/background distinction
- Primary/Secondary dominant (60%+)
- Identifiable peaks (Pivotal)
- Strong use of aspect/tense to mark salience

### Expository (Epistles, especially Romans, Hebrews)
- Less clear foreground (not temporal sequence)
- Background/Setting more common (explanations)
- Primary = main theological points
- Pivotal = theological climaxes (doxologies, credal statements)

### Hortatory (Commands, Exhortations)
- Foreground = commands (imperatives)
- Background = reasons, grounds (indicatives)
- Pivotal = ultimate appeal/motivation

### Poetry (Psalms, Prophets)
- Different structure (parallelism, not sequence)
- Pivotal may be refrain or key metaphor
- Less clear salience hierarchy

## Practical Implementation Guidelines

### For LLM Annotation

**Prompt strategy hierarchy**:
1. **Identify genre** (narrative, expository, hortatory)
2. **Check aspect/tense** (perfective → foreground; imperfective → background)
3. **Test time movement** (advance time → Primary; no advance → Background)
4. **Assess transitivity** (high → Primary; low → Background)
5. **Find peaks** (concentration, underlining → Pivotal)

### Validation Metrics

**Consistency checks**:
- [ ] Narrative has clear foreground/background (not flat distribution)
- [ ] Perfective verbs predominantly Primary/Secondary
- [ ] Imperfective verbs predominantly Background
- [ ] Subordinate clauses predominantly Background (but not always)
- [ ] Pivotal clauses are rare (<10%), marked by concentration/underlining

### Cross-linguistic Validation

**Compare with target language encoding**:
- If Bantu translation uses -ka- → Should be Primary
- If Bantu translation uses -ki- → Should be Background
- If Greek uses aorist (main) → Should be Primary
- If Greek uses imperfect → Should be Background

**Mismatches → Investigate**:
- Source/target grammar differences?
- Genre conventions?
- Translation interpretation?

## Summary

Salience Band annotation rests on **40+ years** of discourse analysis research showing:

1. **Universal distinction**: All languages distinguish foreground/background
2. **Grammatical encoding**: Many languages (especially Bantu) grammatically require it
3. **Gradient prominence**: Not binary, but 5 levels from Pivotal → Setting
4. **Genre-dependent**: Narrative has clearest patterns
5. **Theoretically grounded**: Hopper, Longacre, Givón provide converging evidence

**Critical for translation**: Accurate salience annotation enables:
- Correct verb form selection (Bantu narrative tenses)
- Natural discourse flow (not word-for-word)
- Appropriate information structure (topic-comment)
- Peak identification (narrative climax marking)

**Validation strategy**: Compare TBTA annotations with:
- Published linguistic analysis (Levinsohn, Runge, etc.)
- Target language translations (especially Bantu)
- Native speaker discourse intuitions
