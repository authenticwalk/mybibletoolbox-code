# Language Family Examples: Temporal Systems

Detailed examples of fine-grained temporal systems across the major language families in the TBTA corpus.

## 1. Bantu Languages (Niger-Congo)

Bantu languages exhibit among the world's most complex tense systems with 3-4 distinct past tense degrees.

### Gĩkũyũ (Kenyan Bantu)
- **Four grades of past tense**
- **Three grades of future tense**
- Each grade marks temporal remoteness from present moment
- Tenses organized along "cognitive space" rather than simple linear time

### Isu (Grassfields Bantu, Cameroon)
- Three synthetically marked degrees of past
- Two distinct futures
- Complex interaction with aspect and mood

### Mwera (Bantu, Tanzania)
**Hodiernal Distinctions**:
- **Hodiernal past**: Events that occurred earlier today
- **Pre-hodiernal past**: Events before today
- Additional markers for remote past

### ChiBemba & Swahili
- Up to 5 past tense markers distinguishing temporal remoteness
- Translation challenge: English past tense maps to multiple Bantu forms

**Key Source**: Nurse, Derek (2008). "Tense and Aspect in Bantu" - Details organization of tense/aspect systems along dimensions of temporal remoteness.

**Translation Impact**: Translators must choose from 3-5 past forms for every English past tense, with wrong choice changing meaning significantly.

## 2. Quechuan Languages

Multiple past tenses indicating both temporal distance and evidential value. **18 languages in TBTA corpus.**

### Immediate Past vs. Remote Past Distinction

**-rqa/-ra: Direct experience (witnessed past)**
- "I directly saw/experienced this event"
- Common in narrative introduction and explanations
- Marks recent events speaker participated in

**-sqa/-sha: Indirect experience (non-witnessed/remote past)**
- Events not directly experienced or before speaker's lifetime
- Used for narrative main events and surprise expressions
- Developed from present perfect morphology
- Used for ancient historical events (Genesis creation)

### South Conchucos Quechua Example

**Temporal + Evidential Fusion**:
- Multiple past tense forms place events relative to each other in past time
- Choices between past forms determined by BOTH temporal remoteness AND evidential source
- Tense used metaphorically for narrative structure and emotional distance

**Metaphorical Extension**:
- Remote past forms used with peripheral narrative (orientation, side remarks)
- Immediate past forms used with main narrative events
- Emotional distance: Events speaker regrets may use remote past even if recent

**Key Source**: Hintz, Diane. "Past tense forms and their functions in South Conchucos Quechua" - Academic examination of evidential-tense interaction.

**Translation Implications**:
- Genesis 1:1 "In the beginning God created" → -sqa/-sha (remote, not witnessed)
- Mark 1:21 "They went into Capernaum" → -rqa/-ra (narrative mainline, witnessed tradition)
- Acts 2:1 "When the day of Pentecost came" → -sqa/-sha (historical, not personally witnessed by translator)

---

## 3. Turkish (Turkic, Afro-Asiatic influence)

Obligatory marking of past tense with evidence source.

### -DI (Witnessed/Direct Past)

```
Gördüm = "I saw" (I witnessed it directly)
```

**Usage**:
- Marks actions the speaker witnessed firsthand
- First-person narrative of intentional actions
- Events the speaker can personally vouch for

### -mIş (Inferential/Heard Past)

```
Görülmüş = "I inferred/heard about seeing" (indirect evidence)
```

**Usage**:
- Events speaker didn't witness but inferred from:
  - Hearsay/reported information
  - Visual traces (e.g., "It must have rained" seeing wet ground)
  - Inference from general knowledge
- When combined with first person: indicates unintentional/unconscious action
- Surprise or new information

### Biblical Translation Examples

**Gospel Narratives**:
- Events Jesus performed → -DI (for readers who accept Gospel testimony as direct)
- OR -mIş (for readers receiving reported tradition)
- Translation philosophy determines choice

**Resurrection Reports** (Luke 24:34):
- "The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon" → -mIş
- Disciples reporting what they heard, not what they witnessed directly
- Marks testimonial/hearsay nature

**Dialectal Variation**: Cypriot Turkish has begun losing the -DI/-mIş distinction in modern usage.

**Key Sources**:
- Aksu-Koç, Ayhan: Pioneering work on Turkish evidential acquisition in children
- Turkish Bible translations must choose evidential marking consistently

---

## 4. Georgian (Kartvelian)

Evidentiality marks in past tense through:
- Perfect tense with secondary evidential meaning
- Particle /turme/ for non-witnessed events
- Admirative value in certain past forms

**Similar to Turkish but less grammaticalized.**

---

## 5. Other Evidential Tense Languages

### Komi-Zyrian (Finno-Ugric)
- Direct vs. indirect past distinction
- Common in Uralic languages

### Haida (Language isolate, Alaska/BC)
- Witnessed vs. unwitnessed past
- Critical for traditional storytelling

### Ika (Chibchan, Colombia)
- Direct vs. indirect evidence in past
- Grammaticalized suffixes

---

## 6. Australian Aboriginal Languages

Complex evidential and modal tense-aspect systems. **36 languages in TBTA corpus.**

### Characteristics

**Temporal Marking**:
- Distinction between relative vs. absolute tense (some languages)
- Grammatical expression through clitics/particles rather than inflections
- Mixed focus/temporal meaning (elements paraphrased as 'now' vs. 'then')

**Structural Features**:
- Complex tense-case interactions in some Pama-Nyungan languages
- Modal-tense interactions creating hypothetical/counterfactual meanings
- Polysynthetic morphology: temporal meanings expressed within word structure

**Narrative Function**:
- Temporal/focus clitics CRUCIAL for proper ordering in narrative events
- Distinct from Indo-European reliance on temporal connectives
- Wrong clitic choice disrupts narrative flow

**Research Gap**: Subtle, context-sensitive TAME (Tense-Aspect-Modality-Evidentiality) categories increasingly difficult to document; only fully competent native speakers can provide reliable data.

**Translation Challenge**: Limited documentation makes prediction difficult; requires native speaker consultation.

## 7. Austronesian Languages

More optional TAM marking compared to other major families. **176 languages in TBTA corpus.**

### Characteristics

**Obligatory vs. Optional**:
- Optional vs. obligatory TAM marking varies by language
- Some languages use lexical markers (optional context-dependent)
- Others use preverbal particles/affixes with head-initial structure
- Interaction with focus systems affects tense/mood reading

**Optionality Pattern**:
- Optionality of TAM marking correlates with presence of time adverbials
- "Yesterday I go to market" → past understood from "yesterday," no past tense required
- Less obligatory expression than Indo-European or Bantu

### Examples

**T'boli (Philippines)**:
- Lexicalized morphemes for aspect
- Affix-based focus system
- TAM often inferred from context

**Old Rapa (French Polynesia)**:
- Three tense markers: Imperfective, Progressive, Perfective
- More explicit TAM than typical Austronesian

**Kavalan (Taiwan)**:
- Debate between tense dichotomy (future vs. non-future) vs. mood (realis vs. irrealis)
- Shows typological variation within family

**Translation Implications**: Cannot assume TAM marking is obligatory; check language-specific requirements.

## 8. Trans-New Guinea Languages

Complex but variable tense systems with multiple past distinctions. **141 languages in TBTA corpus.**

### Characteristics

**Common Pattern**:
- Multiple deictic distinctions of temporal distance
- Pattern: Present → Today's past → Yesterday's past → Remote past → Habitual past
- Serial verb constructions for aspect marking (e.g., 'stay' > progressive marker)

**Verbal Morphology**:
- Extensive verbal morphology with large paradigms
- Grammaticalization paths: verbs → tense/aspect meanings
- Diachronic stability in present and remote past
- Instability and variation in middle pasts and future tenses

### Examples

**Amele**:
- Morphological future affix "-an" (irrealis)
- Clear present/past/future distinction

**Mian**:
- Verb s- 'sleep' grammaticalized into hesternal (yesterday) past
- Shows grammaticalization pathway: verb → tense marker

**Kobon**:
- Future suffix "-nab" (irrealis)
- Modal component in future marking

**Hodiernal Systems**:
- Some languages distinguish: Today's past vs Yesterday's past vs Remote past
- Critical for narrative temporal progression

**Translation Implications**: Must check if target language has hodiernal/hesternal distinctions; affects translation of "today" and "yesterday" references in narrative.

## 9. Mayan Languages

Aspect-based rather than tense-based temporal systems. **41 languages in TBTA corpus.**

### Characteristics

**Tenseless Systems**:
- Example: Tzotzil uses binary aspect: completive vs. incompletive
- Temporal meaning expressed through CONTEXT + ASPECT rather than tense affixes
- Time determined by discourse context, not verb form

**Proto-Mayan Reconstruction**:
- 7 aspects: incompletive, progressive, completive, imperative, potential, optative, perfective
- Kaufman's reconstruction shows aspect-dominant system

**Historical Development**:
- Colonial and post-colonial periods: continuous productive formation of tense/aspect/mood auxiliaries
- Recent grammaticalization of auxiliaries for finer TAM distinctions (Yucatec Maya)
- Represents shift from status system (inherited) to auxiliary-based system
- Auxiliary pattern converges across languages despite heterogeneous source constructions

### Status Suffixes

- Related to transitivity and aspectual characteristics
- Not primarily temporal markers

**Translation Implications**:
- Cannot map English tenses directly to Mayan verbs
- Must analyze aspect (completive/incompletive) and context
- Prophecy: incompletive/potential aspect for unreality
- Narrative: completive aspect for completed events
- Teaching: incompletive for ongoing truths

**Key Source**: Kaufman's Proto-Mayan reconstruction showing 7-aspect system.

## 10. Sino-Tibetan Languages

**18 languages in TBTA corpus.**

- Limited documentation of fine-grained tense systems
- More research needed
- Some languages show aspect-prominent systems similar to Chinese

---

## 11. Afro-Asiatic Languages

**25 languages in TBTA corpus.**

### Biblical Hebrew (Example)

**Aspect-Dominant System**:
- Not primarily tense-based
- Qatal: Perfective aspect (completed action)
- Yiqtol: Imperfective aspect (incomplete/ongoing/future)
- Wayyiqtol: Narrative sequential form (narrative mainline)
- Participle: Progressive/present

**Temporal Meaning**:
- Context determines time reference
- Wayyiqtol in narrative → past time
- Yiqtol in prophecy → future time
- Same forms, different time based on genre

**Translation Implications**:
- Source text analysis required
- Genre context critical for time interpretation
- Wayyiqtol → Historic Past in narrative
- Qatal → Perfect or Historic Past depending on context

## Cross-Cutting Linguistic Phenomena

### Metaphorical Extension of Tense

Languages with graded tense systems often extend temporal meanings metaphorically:

**Quechuan**:
- Temporal distance → narrative structure (main vs. peripheral content)
- Temporal distance → emotional affect (regret, surprise)

**Bantu**:
- Temporal remoteness → cognitive "distance" along dimensions beyond chronological time
- Not just "how long ago" but "how distant conceptually"

**English/German**:
- Historical extension of evidential meanings in modal verbs
- German *sollen* 'should' → hearsay marker in some dialects

### Grammaticalization Pathways

Common patterns in language evolution:

1. **Aspect → Tense**: Progressive aspect grammaticalizes into future tense
   - "I am going (to do X)" → future marker

2. **Verb → TAM**: Specific verbs grammaticalize into tense/aspect markers
   - 'stay' → progressive marker
   - 'sleep' → yesterday's past (Mian)
   - 'go' → future marker

3. **Perfect → Evidential**: Perfect tense develops secondary evidential meaning
   - Turkish, Georgian examples
   - Quechuan -sqa/-sha from perfect

4. **Serial constructions → Aspect**: Last verb in serialization becomes aspect marker
   - Common in Trans-New Guinea and West African languages

### Interaction Domains

TAM systems frequently interact with:

**Mood**:
- Modal meanings (hypothetical, counterfactual) combined with tense marking
- Subjunctive often restricts temporal interpretation

**Focus/Word Order**:
- Head-initial languages mark TAM with preverbal particles
- Focus systems may affect temporal reading (Austronesian)

**Agreement**:
- Case and subject agreement morphology interact with tense marking
- Australian languages show tense-case interactions

**Narrative Structure**:
- Tense choices signal narrative organization (main vs. side content)
- Quechuan and Bantu examples show this clearly

## Research Implications for TBTA

### Design Considerations for Fine-Grained Time Marking

1. **Template Structure**: Need flexible fields for:
   - Temporal remoteness degrees (immediate, recent, remote, ancient)
   - Evidential source (witnessed, reported, inferred, unspecified)
   - Aspectual completion (completive, incompletive, progressive, habitual)
   - Modal force (indicative, subjunctive, hypothetical)

2. **Language-Specific Notes**: Important to document:
   - Obligatory vs. optional TAM marking
   - Metaphorical extensions (emotional/narrative distance)
   - Interaction with focus, mood, or agreement systems
   - Grammaticalization patterns and historical development

3. **Citation Requirements**: When analyzing complex temporal systems:
   - Distinguish between direct experience and hearsay
   - Document time-frame accessibility to speakers
   - Note context-dependency of temporal expressions
   - Specify dialectal variation in TAM systems
