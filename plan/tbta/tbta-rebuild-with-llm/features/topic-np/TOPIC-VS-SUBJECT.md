# Topic vs Subject: The Critical Distinction

**Purpose:** Explain the theoretical and practical differences between TOPIC and SUBJECT for Bible translators.

**Key Insight:** Subject is a GRAMMATICAL relation. Topic is a DISCOURSE relation. They often overlap but are fundamentally different.

---

## Quick Definition

| Concept | Definition | Question Answered | Example |
|---------|------------|-------------------|---------|
| **SUBJECT** | Grammatical relation; verb agrees with it | "Who/what does the verb?" | "John runs" (John = subject) |
| **TOPIC** | Discourse relation; what the sentence is "about" | "What is this sentence about?" | "As for fish, I ate them" (fish = topic) |

**Critical:** In English (subject-prominent), subject and topic usually align. In Japanese/Korean/Chinese (topic-prominent), they frequently diverge.

## Li & Thompson (1976): Language Typology

### Four Language Types

| Type | Description | Examples | % of Languages |
|------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| **Subject-prominent** | Subject is primary; topic is marked/emphatic | English, French, German, Russian | ~60-65% |
| **Topic-prominent** | Topic is primary; subject may be implicit | Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Thai | ~25-30% |
| **Both** | Distinct subject AND topic systems | Tagalog, some Austronesian | ~10-15% |
| **Neither** | No clear subject or topic (verb-prominent) | Some Philippine languages | <5% |

**Biblical languages:**
- **Greek:** Subject-prominent (verb agreement, case marking)
- **Hebrew:** Mixed (some topic-prominent features, VSO word order)
- **Aramaic:** Mixed (similar to Hebrew)

**Translation challenge:** Going from subject-prominent (Greek) to topic-prominent (Japanese) requires re-analysis.

## Key Differences

### 1. Grammatical Agreement

| | Subject | Topic |
|---|---------|-------|
| **Verb agreement** | YES (person, number) | NO |
| **Case marking** | Often nominative | No case (or special topic case) |
| **Example (English)** | "He run**s**" (verb agrees) | "Fish, I ate **them**" (no agreement with topic) |

**Japanese example:**
```
Subject: 猫が走る (Neko-GA hashiru - Cat-SUBJ runs)
         → Verb hashiru (run) compatible with "cat"

Topic: 猫は魚が好きだ (Neko-WA sakana-GA suki-da - Cat-TOPIC fish-SUBJ like)
       → Verb suki-da (like) agrees with "fish" (subject), not "cat" (topic)
```

**TBTA implication:** Topic NP value (A/P) may not match verb's grammatical subject.

---

### 2. Syntactic Position

| | Subject | Topic |
|---|---------|-------|
| **Position (English)** | Pre-verbal (SVO) | Sentence-initial (fronted) |
| **Position (Japanese)** | Pre-verbal (SOV) | Sentence-initial (topicalized) |
| **Position (Mandarin)** | Varies (topic-prominent) | Sentence-initial |

**Example (English):**
- Subject: "**God** created the world" (God = subject, pre-verbal)
- Topic: "**The world**, God created it" (world = topic, fronted)

**Japanese:**
- Subject: "神が世界を創造した" (Kami-GA sekai-wo souzou-shita - God-SUBJ world-OBJ created)
- Topic: "神は世界を創造した" (Kami-WA sekai-wo souzou-shita - God-TOPIC world-OBJ created)

**Note:** Japanese topic position is also sentence-initial, but marked by WA particle vs GA particle.

---

### 3. Information Structure (Lambrecht)

| | Subject | Topic |
|---|---------|-------|
| **Information type** | Can be new or given | Typically GIVEN or generic |
| **Definiteness** | Can be indefinite | Usually DEFINITE or generic |
| **Discourse role** | Grammatical pivot | Discourse "aboutness" |

**Chafe's Given vs New:**

| | Given Information | New Information |
|---|------------------|------------------|
| **Typical topic?** | YES - "What we're talking about" | NO - "What I'm telling you" |
| **Typical subject?** | Can be either | Can be either |

**Example:**
```
Q: "Who created the world?"
A: "**God** created it."
   → "God" is NEW → Subject (ga in Japanese)
   → "World" is GIVEN (from question) → could be topic

Q: "What did God do?"
A: "God created **the world**."
   → "God" is GIVEN (from question) → Topic (wa in Japanese)
   → "World" is NEW → Focus
```

**TBTA strategy:** Given information (Participant Tracking = Routine/Restaging) → likely Topic.

---

### 4. Semantic Role Independence

| | Subject | Topic |
|---|---------|-------|
| **Semantic role** | Usually Agent (active) or Patient (passive) | Can be ANY semantic role |
| **Example roles** | Agent: "John runs", Patient: "John was hit" | Agent, Patient, Instrument, Location, Time, etc. |

**Topic can be ANY participant, even oblique:**

**Location topic (Japanese):**
```
"この部屋は窓が大きい"
Kono heya-WA mado-GA ookii
This room-TOPIC window-SUBJ big
"As for this room, the windows are big"
→ Room = topic (location), window = subject
```

**Time topic (Mandarin):**
```
"明天我不來"
Míngtiān wǒ bù lái
Tomorrow I not come
"As for tomorrow, I'm not coming"
→ Tomorrow = topic (time), I = subject
```

**TBTA limitation:** Topic NP only encodes A (agent-like) or P (patient-like), not other roles. This is a simplification.

## Subject-Prominent vs Topic-Prominent Languages

### English (Subject-Prominent)

**Characteristics:**
1. Subject-predicate is UNMARKED structure
2. Topic-comment is MARKED (emphatic, literary)
3. Verb MUST agree with subject (person, number)
4. Indefinite subjects are common: "A man came"

**Topic-fronting in English is marked:**
```
Unmarked: "I ate the fish" (subject-predicate)
Marked: "The fish, I ate it" (topic-comment, emphatic)
         "As for the fish, I ate it" (explicit topic marker)
```

**Translation impact:** Greek → English is natural (both subject-prominent). Greek → Japanese requires topic analysis.

---

### Japanese (Topic-Prominent)

**Characteristics:**
1. Topic-comment is UNMARKED structure
2. Subject-focus is MARKED (exhaustive listing, new info)
3. Verb does NOT agree with topic
4. Indefinite topics are rare: *"A man, came" (unnatural)

**wa (topic) vs ga (subject):**
```
Topic-comment (unmarked):
"象は鼻が長い"
Zou-WA hana-GA nagai
Elephant-TOPIC nose-SUBJ long
"As for elephants, their noses are long" (topic-comment structure)

Subject-focus (marked):
"象が来た"
Zou-GA kita
Elephant-SUBJ came
"An elephant came" (new information, exhaustive)
```

**Translation impact:** Need to determine topic (wa) vs subject (ga) for every NP. TBTA Topic NP (A/P/N) provides this.

---

### Mandarin Chinese (Topic-Prominent, Extreme)

**Characteristics:**
1. NO grammatical subject marking (no agreement, no case)
2. Topic-comment is primary structure
3. "Double subject" constructions (topic + subject both present)
4. Extensive pro-drop of topics

**Double subject construction:**
```
"那棵樹葉子很大"
Nà kē shù yèzi hěn dà
That CL tree leaves very big
"As for that tree, the leaves are very big"
→ Tree = topic, leaves = subject (both overt)
```

**Translation impact:** Must identify topic for proper word order and pro-drop decisions.

---

## Biblical Examples: Topic ≠ Subject

### Example 1: Psalm 118:22 (Patient Topic)

**Hebrew:** אֶבֶן מָאֲסוּ הַבּוֹנִים הָיְתָה לְרֹאשׁ פִּנָּה
**Structure:** Stone (topic) | rejected builders | became cornerstone

**English (subject-prominent):**
"The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone"
→ Stone = subject (verb "has become" agrees)

**Japanese (topic-prominent):**
"建てる者たちが捨てた石は、隅のかしら石になった"
Tateru mono-tachi-GA suteta ishi-WA, sumi-no kashira-ishi-ni natta
Build people-SUBJ rejected stone-TOPIC, corner-GEN head-stone-to became
→ Stone = topic (wa), not subject of "rejected" (builders are subject)

**TBTA:** Topic NP = P (stone is patient of "reject," fronted as topic)

---

### Example 2: Matthew 5:3 (Predicative Topic)

**Greek:** Μακάριοι οἱ πτωχοὶ τῷ πνεύματι
**Structure:** Blessed | the poor in spirit

**English:**
"Blessed are the poor in spirit"
→ Poor = subject (verb "are" agrees)

**Japanese:**
"心の貧しい人々は幸いです"
Kokoro-no mazushii hitobito-WA shiawai desu
Heart-GEN poor people-TOPIC blessed are
→ Poor = topic (wa), predicate is "blessed"

**TBTA:** Topic NP = P (poor are Patient/Experiencer of "blessed")

---

### Example 3: John 1:1 (Topic Shift)

**Greek:** Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος, καὶ ὁ λόγος ἦν πρὸς τὸν θεόν
**Structure:** In beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God

**English (subject-prominent):**
"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God"
→ Word = subject (both clauses)

**Korean (topic-prominent):**
"태초에 말씀이 계셨고, 말씀은 하나님과 함께 계셨다"
Taecho-e malsseum-I gyesyeotgo, malsseum-EUN hananim-gwa hamkke gyesyeotda
Beginning-at Word-SUBJ existed, Word-TOPIC God-with together existed

**Analysis:**
- First clause: Word = NEW → i/ga (subject marker)
- Second clause: Word = GIVEN → eun/neun (topic marker)

**TBTA:** Topic NP = N (first clause), Topic NP = A (second clause)

---

## Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: "Topic = Theme"
**Problem:** Confusing topic (grammar) with theme (content)

**Clarification:**
- **Topic:** Discourse-structural role (what sentence is about)
- **Theme:** Semantic content (love, redemption, judgment, etc.)

A sentence about "fish" (topic) can have a theme of "God's provision."

---

### Misconception 2: "Topic = Old Information"
**Problem:** Assuming topics are always discourse-given

**Clarification:**
Topics are TYPICALLY given, but can be:
- **Generic:** "Dogs (in general) are loyal" (generic topic, not previously mentioned)
- **Contrastive:** "As for ME, I believe" (new topic introduced for contrast)
- **Scene-setting:** "Yesterday (time topic), I went to the market"

**Better rule:** Topics are typically DEFINITE or GENERIC, not indefinite.

---

### Misconception 3: "Topic-fronting = Emphasis"
**Problem:** Assuming topic-fronting is always emphatic

**Clarification:**
- **In English:** Topic-fronting IS marked/emphatic ("Fish, I ate them")
- **In Japanese:** Topic-comment is UNMARKED/default ("Sakana-wa tabemashita" = neutral)

Don't project English patterns onto topic-prominent languages!

---

### Misconception 4: "Every sentence has a topic"
**Problem:** Forcing topic analysis on all clauses

**Clarification:**
- **Presentational/Existential:** "There is a man" → No topic (introduces new entity)
- **Weather:** "It's raining" → No topic (impersonal)
- **Imperatives:** "Go!" → No topic (addressee is implicit)

**TBTA:** Topic NP = N for these cases.

---

## Practical Translation Guide

### Step 1: Identify TBTA Topic NP Value
- **A** (agent-like) → Likely agent/subject, fronted as topic
- **P** (patient-like) → Likely patient/object, fronted as topic
- **N** (no topic) → Subject-predicate structure, or no clear topic

### Step 2: Check Target Language Type
- **Subject-prominent (English, French):** Use subject-predicate structure; topic-fronting only for emphasis
- **Topic-prominent (Japanese, Korean, Mandarin):** Use topic-comment structure; apply topic markers
- **Both (Tagalog):** Align voice system with topic (agent voice vs patient voice)

### Step 3: Determine Topic Marker/Strategy
- **Japanese:** wa (topic) vs ga (subject) particle selection
- **Korean:** eun/neun (topic) vs i/ga (subject) particle selection
- **Mandarin:** Sentence-initial position, optional 的話 (de huà)
- **Tagalog:** Voice selection (agent voice if agent=topic, patient voice if patient=topic)

### Step 4: Check Topic Continuity
- If same topic across 3+ clauses → Pro-drop possible (Japanese ∅ wa, Korean ∅ eun/neun)
- See Participant Tracking + Surface Realization features

## Linguistic Theory References

### Li & Thompson (1976)
**"Subject and Topic: A New Typology of Language"**

Key contribution: Identified topic-prominence as distinct language type, separate from subject-prominence.

**Four-way typology:** Subject-prominent, Topic-prominent, Both, Neither.

### Lambrecht (1994)
**"Information Structure and Sentence Form"**

Key contribution: Topic is PRAGMATIC (discourse function), subject is GRAMMATICAL (syntax).

**Topic:** "What the sentence is about" (discourse-given, frame-setting)
**Focus:** "What is asserted about the topic" (discourse-new, informative)

### Chafe (1976)
**"Givenness, Contrastiveness, Definiteness, Subjects, Topics"**

Key contribution: Distinguishing given vs new information, relating to topic/focus.

**Given:** Previously mentioned or contextually available
**New:** Not previously mentioned or contextually available
**Topic:** Typically given (but not always)

## Summary

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Topic ≠ Subject:** Subject is grammatical (verb agreement, case), topic is discourse (aboutness)
2. **Language types:** ~60% subject-prominent, ~25% topic-prominent, ~15% mixed/neither
3. **Translation impact:** Greek (subject-prominent) → Japanese (topic-prominent) requires topic analysis
4. **TBTA Topic NP:** Encodes whether clause has topic (A/P) or not (N), critical for topic-prominent languages
5. **Information structure:** Topics are typically given/definite, not new/indefinite
6. **Particle selection:** Japanese wa/ga, Korean eun/neun determined by topic vs subject distinction

**For Translators:**

- Always check TBTA Topic NP when translating into topic-prominent languages
- Don't assume subject = topic (they diverge frequently)
- Use topic markers (wa, eun/neun) for given/contrastive information
- Use subject markers (ga, i) for new/exhaustive information
- See TOPIC-PROMINENT-LANGUAGES.md for language-specific rules
