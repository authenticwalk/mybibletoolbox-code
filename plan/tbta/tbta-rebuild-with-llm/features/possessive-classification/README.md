# Possessive Classification

**Status:** Documentation complete
**TBTA Relevance:** High - affects Austronesian (172 langs), Mayan (22 langs), Trans-New Guinea (129 langs)
**Greek/Hebrew:** Not grammaticalized - possession shows distinctions lexically but not grammatically

## Overview

Possessive classification systems grammatically distinguish different types of possessive relationships. Most commonly, languages distinguish **inalienable possession** (inherent, inseparable) from **alienable possession** (acquired, separable). Some languages have 5-32 distinct possessive classes.

This feature is absent from Greek and Hebrew, which express possession through genitive constructions without grammatical classification.

## Cross-Linguistic Patterns

### Basic 2-Way System (Inalienable/Alienable)

**Inalienable possession:**
- Body parts (my hand, my eyes)
- Kinship terms (my father, my sister)
- Often: spiritual/mental states

**Alienable possession:**
- Objects (my book, my house)
- Possessions (my money, my field)
- Acquired relationships

### Extended Systems (3-32 Classes)

**Oceanic Austronesian (3-5 classes):**
- Inalienable (inherent)
- Alienable general (separable objects)
- Alienable food (to be eaten)
- Alienable drink (to be drunk)
- Sometimes: sacred/ritual class

**Trans-New Guinea (up to 32 classes!):**
- **Amele example:** 32 distinct possessive classes
- Categories by use, function, cultural importance
- Tools, food types, ritual objects, etc.

## Language Family Examples

### Austronesian (Fijian - 4 classes)
**Inalienable:** `noqu yaca` (my name - part of me)
**Alienable general:** `noqu vola` (my book - can be separated)
**Alienable food:** `kequ ika` (my fish - to be eaten)
**Alienable drink:** `mequ wai` (my water - to be drunk)

**Micronesian expansion:** Up to 5 categories in some languages

### Mayan (K'iche' - 2 way)
**Inalienable:** `nu-q'aq'` (my hand) - direct possessive prefix
**Inalienable kinship:** `nu-tat` (my father) - direct marking
**Alienable:** Requires special possessive constructions, sometimes with classifiers

### Trans-New Guinea (Amele - 32 classes!)
**Inalienable:** Body parts, kinship (no classifier)
**Alienable:** Objects, possessions (requires classifier)
**32 distinct classes:** By function, shape, cultural use

## Biblical Translation Examples

### Matthew 6:9 - "Our Father"
**Greek:** πάτερ ἡμῶν (father our-GEN)
**Inalienable marking:** Inherent kinship relationship
**Theological impact:** Emphasizes unbreakable relationship with God
**Choice:** Inalienable (not acquired/adopted relationship)

### Matthew 6:11 - "Our daily bread"
**Greek:** τὸν ἄρτον ἡμῶν (the bread our-GEN)
**Alienable food class:** Bread to be eaten
**Theological impact:** Material provision, not inherent possession
**Oceanic:** Uses food-class possessive

### Matthew 26:26 - "This is my body"
**Greek:** τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ σῶμά μου (this is the body my-GEN)
**Inalienable:** Body part possession
**Theological impact:** Emphasizes material reality of body
**Eucharistic theology:** Body is inalienable (part of Jesus' being)

### John 10:27 - "My sheep"
**Greek:** τὰ πρόβατά μου (the sheep my-GEN)
**Alienable general:** Owned but separable
**Metaphorical:** Believers as "owned" but not inherent parts
**Choice affects:** How believers understand relationship to Christ

### Romans 8:9 - "Spirit of God dwells in you"
**Greek:** πνεῦμα θεοῦ (spirit God-GEN)
**Inalienable or special spiritual class:** Divine possession
**Theological debate:** Is Spirit inherent to God's being or sent/given?
**Some languages:** Create special class for divine/spiritual possession

### Luke 12:33 - "Sell your possessions"
**Greek:** τὰ ὑπάρχοντα ὑμῶν (the possessions your-GEN)
**Alienable:** Material possessions (clearly separable)
**Reinforces:** Separation from material identity

## Cultural Variations

### Theological Relationships

**"Our Father" as inalienable:**
- Emphasizes inherent, unbreakable relationship
- Cannot be lost or separated
- Theologically significant for adoption/new birth passages

**"Our Father" as alienable:**
- Might emphasize choice/adoption aspect
- Less common but some translators choose this

### Sacred/Spiritual Class

**Some cultures create special possessive class for:**
- God's attributes
- Spiritual realities
- Sacred objects
- Ritual items

**Example:** "God's love" might use different possessive than "my love"

### Land and Inheritance

**Traditional cultures (especially Oceanic):**
- "Our land" may be inalienable (sacred connection to ancestors)
- Affects translation of inheritance passages
- Property rights understood differently

**Island cultures:**
- Sea/fishing terms often have special possessive classes
- Affects fishing metaphors in Gospels

### Family Relationships

**Extended family systems:**
- Nuclear family kinship = inalienable
- Extended family = may vary
- Affects "brothers and sisters in Christ" passages

## Translation Challenges

### Ambiguous Greek Genitives

Greek genitive is semantically flexible:
- Subjective genitive: "love of God" (God loves)
- Objective genitive: "love of God" (we love God)
- Possessive genitive: "love of God" (God's love as attribute)

**Possessive classification forces decision:**
- Must choose inalienable (God's inherent attribute) or alienable (displayed love)

### Metaphorical Possession

**"Body of Christ" (church):**
- Inalienable (organic unity, inseparable parts)?
- Alienable (gathered community, can leave)?
- Choice affects ecclesiology

**"Children of God":**
- Inalienable kinship (emphasizes new birth)?
- Alienable relationship (emphasizes adoption)?

### Material vs Spiritual

**"Our salvation":**
- Inalienable (inherent to believers' new identity)?
- Alienable (gift received)?
- Special spiritual class?

## Interaction with Other TBTA Features

### With Kinship Specificity (Niger-Congo)
Possessive class interacts with kinship specificity:
- Older/younger sibling distinction + inalienable marking
- Maternal/paternal uncle distinction + possessive class

### With Person/Clusivity
**"Our Father" in Austronesian:**
- Inclusive or exclusive "our"?
- Plus inalienable possessive class
- Double grammatical decision required

### With Participant Tracking
Inalienable possession often co-references participant:
- "Jesus raised his hand" → inalienable possession = clear reference
- Helps track participants through inalienable relationships

## Data Requirements for TBTA

### Per-Verse Annotation

For each possessive construction, annotate:
1. **Possessive type:** Inalienable, alienable, or ambiguous?
2. **Semantic category:** Body part, kinship, object, abstract, spiritual?
3. **Theological significance:** Does choice affect doctrine?
4. **Metaphorical use:** Literal or figurative possession?

### Language-Specific Documentation

For each language with possessive classification:
- How many classes?
- What are the categories (if more than 2)?
- Which biblical terms fall into which classes?
- Are there special religious/spiritual classes?
- Cultural considerations for class assignment?

## Variants by Family

### Austronesian (172 languages)
**Strong in Oceanic (~109 languages):**
- 2-5 possessive classes
- Food/drink distinction common
- Sacred land/sea possessive classes in some

**Weaker in Philippine/Indonesian:**
- Philippine type: minimal distinction
- Indonesian: lost most possessive classification
- More analytical constructions

### Mayan (22 languages - all have it)
**All 22 languages distinguish inalienable/alienable:**
- Inalienable: direct possessive prefix
- Alienable: special constructions, sometimes with classifiers
- Universal pattern across family

### Trans-New Guinea (129 languages)
**Variable systems:**
- Many languages have inalienable/alienable distinction
- Some languages (like Amele): 32 possessive classes!
- By function, shape, cultural importance
- Tools/gardens may have special classes in subsistence cultures

## Research Gaps

1. Comprehensive mapping of biblical terms to possessive classes across languages
2. How different theological traditions handle ambiguous cases
3. Special religious/spiritual classes in Christianized communities
4. Interaction with Greek genitive ambiguity (subjective/objective/possessive)
5. Diachronic change: Do new possessive classes emerge for Christian concepts?

## Recommendations

### For TBTA Annotation

1. **Mark all possessive constructions in Greek/Hebrew**
   - Identify semantic category (body, kinship, object, abstract, spiritual)
   - Note theological significance
   - Flag ambiguous cases

2. **Create semantic taxonomy**
   - Body parts (sub-categories if needed)
   - Kinship (nuclear vs extended)
   - Material objects (by type)
   - Abstract concepts
   - Spiritual/divine attributes

3. **Document theological implications**
   - Which terms have doctrinal weight?
   - How does class choice affect meaning?
   - Cultural variations in assignment

### For Tool Development

1. **Automatic classification suggestions**
   - Based on semantic category
   - With theological notes for doctrinally significant terms

2. **Language-specific mapping**
   - Map biblical terms to language-specific possessive classes
   - Document cultural considerations

3. **Cross-reference translations**
   - How have existing translations handled ambiguous cases?
   - Document patterns across languages

### For Translation Practice

1. **Theological awareness**
   - Class choice can affect doctrine
   - Consult community on significant terms
   - "Our Father" especially critical

2. **Cultural sensitivity**
   - Understand target culture's possessive categories
   - Land, family, spiritual concepts may differ
   - Don't impose source culture categories

3. **Consistency**
   - Use same class for same terms across contexts
   - Unless context requires different class
   - Document decisions for translation team
